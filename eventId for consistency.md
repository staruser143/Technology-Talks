Yes, you can use **`eventID`** for **idempotency checks** and still ensure the **correct order of events** being added to the Event Store. However, these are two separate concerns, and they require different mechanisms to address. Let’s break this down:

---

### **1. Using `eventID` for Idempotency Checks**
The **`eventID`** is a unique identifier for each event (e.g., a UUID). You can use it to ensure that the same event is not processed multiple times, even if it is retried due to network issues or failures.

#### **How It Works**:
- Before appending an event to the Event Store, check if an event with the same `eventID` already exists.
- If the event already exists, skip the append operation to avoid duplicates.

#### **Example**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Events WHERE eventID = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
```
If the count is greater than 0, the event is a duplicate and should be skipped.

#### **Idempotency in Projections**:
- Ensure that your **projection logic** is idempotent. This means processing the same event multiple times should not change the state of the read model.
- Example:
  - If the event is a "QuoteUpdated" event, applying it multiple times should result in the same final state.

---

### **2. Ensuring Correct Order of Events**
Ensuring the correct order of events is a separate concern. Even if you use `eventID` for idempotency checks, you still need a mechanism to enforce the **order of events** within a stream (e.g., events for a specific `quoteID`).

#### **How It Works**:
- Use a **sequence number** or **timestamp** to enforce the order of events.
- When appending an event, ensure that its sequence number is greater than the last event in the stream.

#### **Example**:
- Each event includes a `sequenceNumber`:
  ```json
  {
    "eventID": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "quoteID": "quote-123",
    "sequenceNumber": 5,
    "eventType": "QuoteUpdated",
    "data": {
      "premium": 1200
    }
  }
  ```
- Before appending the event, check the last `sequenceNumber` for the `quoteID`:
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(sequenceNumber) FROM Events WHERE quoteID = 'quote-123'
  ```
- If the new event’s `sequenceNumber` is not exactly one greater than the last `sequenceNumber`, reject the event or handle it appropriately.

#### **Optimistic Concurrency Control**:
- Use optimistic concurrency control to ensure that events are appended in the correct order.
- Example:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Events (eventID, quoteID, sequenceNumber, eventType, data)
  VALUES ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'quote-123', 5, 'QuoteUpdated', '{"premium": 1200}')
  WHERE sequenceNumber = 4
  ```
  If the condition fails (e.g., another event with `sequenceNumber = 5` was already appended), the operation will fail, and you can retry with the correct `sequenceNumber`.

---

### **3. Combining `eventID` and `sequenceNumber`**
You can use both `eventID` and `sequenceNumber` to achieve **idempotency** and **correct ordering**.

#### **Example Schema**:
```json
{
  "eventID": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", // Unique ID for idempotency
  "quoteID": "quote-123",                            // Partition key
  "sequenceNumber": 5,                               // Ensures correct order
  "eventType": "QuoteUpdated",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "premium": 1200
  }
}
```

#### **Workflow**:
1. **Generate Event**:
   - Assign a unique `eventID` (e.g., UUID).
   - Assign a `sequenceNumber` that is one greater than the last event in the stream.

2. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - Use `eventID` to check if the event has already been processed.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Events WHERE eventID = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
     ```

3. **Append Event**:
   - Use `sequenceNumber` to ensure the event is appended in the correct order.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO Events (eventID, quoteID, sequenceNumber, eventType, data)
     VALUES ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'quote-123', 5, 'QuoteUpdated', '{"premium": 1200}')
     WHERE sequenceNumber = 4
     ```

4. **Handle Conflicts**:
   - If the append operation fails due to a concurrency conflict, retry with the correct `sequenceNumber`.

---

### **4. Summary**
- **`eventID`**: Use for **idempotency checks** to avoid duplicate event processing.
- **`sequenceNumber`**: Use to ensure the **correct order of events** within a stream.
- **Partition Key**: Use `quoteID` as the partition key to group related events and enable efficient querying.

By combining these mechanisms, you can ensure that your Event Store is both **idempotent** and **consistent**, even in a distributed system.
