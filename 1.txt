>> Character is the sum
of our whole selvesâ€”our traits, our virtues
and our values. We see character in
everything leaders do, and particularly in their decisions
and communications. We also see the critical
role of judgment. Researchers at
Ivey Business School in Canada identified judgment as the leading cause
of bad decisions. Our judgment dictates
when and how we behave; for example, how do we
respond when things go wrong? Observing others, particularly
in crisis situations, is a great way to start
our own character development. It's also easier sometimes to identify character
strengths and development opportunities
in others than it is to identify
them in ourselves. So, let's consider an example. Tomas is a team leader. During a department meeting he presents an idea as his
own, but the idea really came from Stephanie, an intern,
and he doesn't credit her. What does this situation reveal
about Tomas's character? Well, we might say that
he used poor judgment. Even at a baseline level
of moral reasoning, it's quite possible that
others will find out it's Stephanie's idea, and that would reflect badly on Tomas. Looking at the
character dimensions, we would probably say
Tomas lacks integrity. He doesn't entirely tell
the truth, or at least he omit some
important information. And he also lacks humility: the ability to learn
from others and to admit that others might have
better ideas than we do. So, now let's imagine Tomas has made
a different decision. In addition to giving credit, Tomas might also ask Stephanie to present
her idea at the meeting. This further demonstrates
his character because he shows humility by making
some space for her. He doesn't put himself above her and he also gives Stephanie the opportunity to be
publicly recognized and to practice her presentation skills
in front of the team. In these two examples, we see how actions and
communication reveal character strengths and
character weaknesses.
