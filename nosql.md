Why Choose Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API for Event Sourcing and Read Model Storage

Introduction

Event Sourcing architecture involves storing state changes as a sequence of events in an event store. Projections from these events are used to build domain-specific read models. For such a system, selecting the right data store is crucial for scalability, performance, and cost efficiency. This document outlines the advantages of using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API as both an event store and read model domain store, compared to alternatives such as Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API and Atlas MongoDB.

Benefits of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API

1. Global Distribution and High Availability

Azure Cosmos DB offers native multi-region replication with high availability and consistency models.

Built-in global distribution ensures lower read/write latency for geographically distributed applications.


2. Elastic Scalability and Performance

Provisioned throughput and serverless modes allow fine-grained control over resource allocation.

Supports high write and read throughput critical for event sourcing systems that require frequent event ingestion and query-heavy read models.


3. Flexible and Dynamic Schema

Schema-agnostic nature fits perfectly for event sourcing, where events may evolve over time.

Read models built from event projections can be tailored without rigid schema requirements.


4. Optimized for Low Latency Read and Write Operations

Tuned for millisecond-level response times with direct indexing of JSON documents.

Offers predictable performance crucial for both event ingestion and querying read models.


5. Advanced Consistency Models

Supports multiple consistency levels (Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, and Eventual).

Developers can choose appropriate consistency models based on event ordering requirements and read model freshness.


6. Comprehensive Integration with Azure Services

Native integration with Azure Functions, Event Grid, and Logic Apps simplifies reactive event-driven architecture.

Supports seamless integration with Azure Event Hubs for event ingestion.


7. Rich Querying Capabilities

SQL-like query language for efficient querying of JSON documents.

Projections from event streams can be queried flexibly for different read model requirements.

Why Not Cosmos DB for MongoDB API or Atlas MongoDB?

Cosmos DB for MongoDB API

Designed primarily for MongoDB compatibility rather than optimized for native Cosmos DB features.

Limited support for advanced consistency models and integration capabilities with other Azure services.


Atlas MongoDB

Strong contender but lacks native integration with Azure services.

Higher operational overhead for managing and maintaining cross-region replication.

Licensing and support considerations add complexity for large-scale enterprise systems.

Conclusion

Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API provides a robust and scalable solution for both event sourcing and read model domain storage. Its integration with the Azure ecosystem, global distribution, and low-latency performance make it a superior choice compared to Cosmos DB for MongoDB API and Atlas MongoDB for building event-driven systems on Azure.
