If different pods in your AKS cluster need access to different Azure services (or even different levels of access to the same service), you should repeat the process for each unique set of required permissions.

Here's why and how you would do it:

## Why Repeat the Process?

 * **Principle of Least Privilege**: Granting each pod only the exact permissions it needs is a fundamental security best practice. You don't want a pod that only reads from a Blob container to have permissions to write to a database or access secrets in Key Vault.
 * **Isolation and Security**: If one pod's identity is compromised, the blast radius is limited to the Azure resources that specific identity has access to.
 * **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Managing permissions becomes more organized and understandable when each workload (represented by a set of pods) has its own distinct identity and associated permissions
   .
### How to Repeat the Process (using Azure AD Workload Identity as the recommended approach):

For each set of pods requiring a unique set of Azure service access:
 * Create a New Azure AD Application:
   * Give it a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the pods it will represent (e.g., pod-writer-identity, image-processor-identity).
   * Note down the appId (client ID) of this new application.
   *
```
APPLICATION_NAME="pod-writer-identity"
az ad app create --display-name $APPLICATION_NAME
CLIENT_ID_WRITER="<new-app-id>"

```
 * Create a New Kubernetes Service Account (if needed):
   * If the pods needing this specific set of permissions are already using a dedicated service account, you can reuse it.
   * If not, create a new service account in the appropriate namespace.
```
NAMESPACE="your-namespace"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="pod-writer-sa"
kubectl create serviceaccount $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
```

 * Create a New Federated Identity Credential:
   * Link the new Azure AD application to the Kubernetes service account used by the target pods.
   * Use the OIDC issuer URL of your AKS cluster.
```
AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-aks-resource-group>"
AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="<your-aks-cluster-name>"
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-azure-subscription-id>"
ISSUER_URL=$(az aks show -g $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUri" -o tsv)
NAMESPACE="your-namespace"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="pod-writer-sa"
```

```
az identity federated-credential create --name "pod-writer-federated-identity" \
    --identity-id $CLIENT_ID_WRITER \
    --issuer "$ISSUER_URL" \
    --subject system:serviceaccount:$NAMESPACE:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange
```

 * Grant Specific Permissions to the New Azure AD Application:
   * Assign the necessary Azure RBAC roles to the new Azure AD application on the specific Azure services it needs to access. For example, if these pods need to write to a specific Blob container, you would assign the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role to the CLIENT_ID_WRITER on that container.
```
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="<your-storage-account-name>"
CONTAINER_NAME="<your-writer-container-name>"
CONTAINER_ID_WRITER=$(az storage container show --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --name $CONTAINER_NAME --query "id" -o tsv)
OBJECT_ID_WRITER=$(az ad app show --id $CLIENT_ID_WRITER --query "objectId" -o tsv)
```

```
az role assignment create --assignee $OBJECT_ID_WRITER \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --scope $CONTAINER_ID_WRITER
```
 * Update Your Pod Deployment:
   * Ensure the pods that require these specific permissions are configured to use the Kubernetes service account you linked to the new Azure AD application in their pod.spec.serviceAccountName.
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-writer-deployment
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  # ... other deployment specifications ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pod-writer-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: pod-writer-sa # Use the specific service account
      containers:
      - name: pod-writer-container
        image: <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/<your-writer-app-image>:<tag>
        # ... environment variables etc. ...
```
Repeat this entire process for each distinct set of access requirements. This ensures that each group of pods has its own Azure AD identity with precisely the permissions needed, adhering to the principle of least privilege and enhancing the security of your AKS environment.
