You're right to ask! The OIDC issuer URL is crucial for establishing the trust between your AKS cluster and the Azure AD application when using Azure AD Workload Identity. Here are a few ways to get the correct OIDC issuer URL for your AKS cluster:
1. Using the Azure CLI (Recommended):
The Azure CLI provides the most straightforward and reliable way to retrieve the OIDC issuer URL for your specific AKS cluster.
AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-aks-resource-group>"
AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="<your-aks-cluster-name>"

ISSUER_URL=$(az aks show -g $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUri" -o tsv)

echo "OIDC Issuer URL: $ISSUER_URL"

Replace <your-aks-resource-group> and <your-aks-cluster-name> with the actual names of your AKS resource group and cluster.
This command directly queries the AKS cluster's configuration and retrieves the issuerUri from the oidcIssuerProfile. This is the most accurate way to get the URL for your specific cluster.
2. Constructing the URL (Less Reliable, Use with Caution):
While the Azure CLI method is preferred, you can sometimes construct the URL based on your cluster's location. However, this method is less reliable as the exact format might change or vary slightly depending on the Azure region and AKS version.
The general format often looks like this:
https://oidc.prod-<azure-region>.workload.azure.com/<your-azure-subscription-id>/oidc

You would need to replace <azure-region> with the Azure region where your AKS cluster is located (e.g., eastus2, westeurope, southeastasia) and <your-azure-subscription-id> with your Azure subscription ID.
Example:
If your AKS cluster is in eastus2 and your subscription ID is xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, the constructed URL would be:
https://oidc.prod-eastus2.workload.azure.com/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/oidc

Why is the Azure CLI method preferred?
 * Accuracy: It directly fetches the configured issuer URL for your specific cluster, eliminating the risk of typos or incorrect region assumptions.
 * Dynamic Updates: If Azure updates the OIDC issuer endpoint structure, the CLI will reflect the correct URL for your cluster. Relying on a constructed URL might break if the underlying structure changes.
 * Simplicity: It's a single command that provides the information you need.
How to use the OIDC Issuer URL:
Once you have the OIDC issuer URL (ideally obtained using the Azure CLI), you will use it in the --issuer parameter when creating the federated identity credential using the az identity federated-credential create command, as shown in the previous detailed example:
az identity federated-credential create --name "aks-workload-identity" \
    --identity-id $CLIENT_ID \
    --issuer "$ISSUER_URL" \
    --subject system:serviceaccount:$NAMESPACE:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange

In summary, always prioritize using the Azure CLI command az aks show to retrieve the OIDC issuer URL for your specific AKS cluster to ensure accuracy and avoid potential issues.
