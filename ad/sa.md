Yes, generally, you would create a new Kubernetes Service Account for each distinct set of pods that require a unique Azure AD identity and a unique set of permissions to Azure services.
Here's the reasoning:
 * Granular Identity Mapping: The federated identity credential you create explicitly links a specific Azure AD application to a specific Kubernetes Service Account within a particular namespace. If different sets of pods need to authenticate as different Azure AD applications (because they require different permissions), they need to be associated with different Service Accounts that are linked to those respective Azure AD applications.
 * Clarity and Management: Using separate Service Accounts makes it much clearer which pods are associated with which Azure AD identity and, consequently, which Azure services they have access to. This simplifies management and troubleshooting.
 * Flexibility: Different sets of pods might reside in different namespaces within your AKS cluster. Service Accounts are namespaced resources, so you'll naturally have different Service Accounts in different namespaces.
Think of it this way:
The Kubernetes Service Account acts as the "subject" in the federated identity credential. It's the Kubernetes-level identity that Azure AD Workload Identity trusts. If two different groups of pods need to authenticate as two different Azure AD applications, they need two different Kubernetes-level subjects (Service Accounts) to establish those separate trust relationships.
When might you reuse a Service Account?
You could potentially reuse a Service Account if:
 * The different sets of pods need the exact same Azure AD identity and the exact same set of permissions. This scenario is less common as different workloads often have different access requirements.
 * You are managing permissions at a very high level and are willing to grant a broader set of permissions to multiple workloads. However, this goes against the principle of least privilege and is generally not recommended for security reasons.
In practice, for each unique set of Azure service access requirements for a group of pods, you would typically follow these steps:
 * Create a new Azure AD Application.
 * Create a new Kubernetes Service Account (in the appropriate namespace for those pods).
 * Create a new Federated Identity Credential linking the new Azure AD Application to the new Kubernetes Service Account.
 * Grant the necessary Azure RBAC roles to the new Azure AD Application.
 * Configure the deployment of the pods to use the new Kubernetes Service Account.
By following this pattern, you ensure a secure and well-organized approach to managing access to Azure services from your AKS pods.
