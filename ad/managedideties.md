You are absolutely correct! My apologies for the potential confusion. The method we detailed for Azure AD Workload Identity does indeed leverage managed identities under the hood, but it's a specific type of managed identity and a more streamlined approach compared to directly using the AKS cluster's system-assigned or a user-assigned managed identity for individual pod access.
Let's clarify the relationship:
 * Managed Identities are the foundational Azure feature that provides an identity for Azure resources, eliminating the need to manage credentials in code.
 * Azure AD Workload Identity is built on top of this foundation. It allows you to assign an Azure AD identity (represented by an Azure AD application) to a Kubernetes service account. The AKS control plane and the Azure AD Workload Identity components then work together to enable pods using that service account to authenticate as that Azure AD application without needing explicit managed identity assignment at the AKS cluster level or to individual nodes.
Here's a breakdown of why it might seem like managed identities aren't directly used in the traditional sense:
 * No Direct Assignment to AKS Cluster or Nodes: With Azure AD Workload Identity, you don't explicitly enable the system-assigned managed identity on the AKS cluster and then grant it permissions. You also don't assign a user-assigned managed identity to the cluster or individual node pools.
 * Focus on the Azure AD Application: The primary identity you're interacting with and granting permissions to is the Azure AD application you created.
 * Kubernetes Service Account as the Link: The bridge between the pod and the Azure AD identity is the Kubernetes service account. The federated identity credential you create maps the service account's OIDC tokens to the Azure AD application.
However, the underlying mechanism relies on Azure's ability to securely attest to the identity of the pod through the Kubernetes service account's JWT tokens, and this trust is established and managed within the Azure infrastructure, which is the core concept of managed identities.
Is using the AKS cluster's system-assigned or a user-assigned managed identity for individual pod access optional or not required with Azure AD Workload Identity?
It is generally optional and often less granular and less secure than using Azure AD Workload Identity for pod-level access.
Here's why:
 * Less Granular Control: If you use the AKS cluster's system-assigned or a user-assigned managed identity, all pods within the cluster that have access to the necessary Azure SDK and configuration could potentially use that identity. This violates the principle of least privilege.
 * Wider Blast Radius: If the cluster-level identity is compromised, the impact could be broader than if a specific Azure AD application tied to a specific workload is compromised.
 * Complexity of Management: Managing access based on the cluster-level identity for individual pod needs can become complex as your application landscape grows.
Azure AD Workload Identity provides a more secure and granular approach by:
 * Pod-Specific Identities: Allowing you to assign distinct Azure AD identities to different workloads (pods) based on their specific needs.
 * Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary permissions to each workload's identity.
 * Simplified Authentication: Eliminating the need for connection strings or secrets within the pods.
In summary:
While Azure AD Workload Identity builds upon the foundation of Azure's managed identity framework, it offers a more fine-grained and secure way to manage identities for individual pods compared to directly leveraging the AKS cluster's system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities for this purpose. For granting specific permissions to applications running in pods to access Azure services, Azure AD Workload Identity is the recommended and more secure approach.
Thank you for pointing out this nuance! It's important to be precise about how these identity mechanisms work together.
