Yes, **Azure Logic Apps can maintain state**, but how it does so depends on the **type of Logic App** you're using: **Standard** or **Consumption**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Logic Apps Standard (Stateful Workflows)**
- **Yes, fully stateful.**
- Runs on **Azure App Service** and supports **long-running workflows**.
- Maintains **execution state automatically** across actions, including across:
  - **Wait actions** (e.g., delays, triggers waiting for events)
  - **Suspend/resume patterns**
  - **Event-driven workflows** (like waiting for a callback or HTTP request)
- Uses **durable execution** ‚Äî if a workflow waits for an external event (e.g., an approval or a manual trigger), the state is persisted until the event occurs.
- Supports **checkpointing**: the system saves state after each action, enabling recovery and tracking.
- Ideal for workflows that run over **hours, days, or even months**.

üîπ Example:  
A workflow that starts, waits 7 days for approval, then continues ‚Äî the state is preserved during the wait.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. **Logic Apps Consumption (Legacy/Serverless)**
- **Limited state management** ‚Äî technically **stateless by design**, but with some persistence.
- Each trigger and action is processed in a **stateless runtime**, but:
  - Azure manages **some internal state** (e.g., tracking workflow run history, correlation IDs).
  - It can **wait for callbacks** (e.g., using the **"Wait for HTTP request"** pattern), but this relies on **callback URLs with SAS tokens** that are tracked by the system.
  - The **state is not stored in your code**, but the platform handles it behind the scenes for limited durations.
- **Not designed for long-running workflows** (e.g., workflows that pause for days).
- Maximum execution time: **90 days**, but best practice is for short-lived workflows (< 5 min).

üîπ Example:  
You can use the **"Wait for HTTP request"** action to pause and wait for an external system to call back ‚Äî the platform keeps track of that pending state temporarily.

| Feature                              | Logic Apps Standard | Logic Apps Consumption |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Fully stateful workflows             | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ùå No (limited)        |
| Long-running workflows (days/months) | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited             |
| Built-in state persistence           | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform-managed only |
| Checkpointing & recovery             | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ùå No                  |
| Wait for external events (callbacks) | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes (with limits)   |
| Best for complex, stateful logic     | ‚úÖ Recommended      | ‚ùå Not ideal           |

### Best Practices for State Management
- Use **Logic Apps Standard** if you need reliable, long-term state persistence.
- For Consumption plan, avoid relying on state for extended periods ‚Äî design workflows to be **as stateless as possible**.
- Use **Azure Functions** or **Durable Functions** in combination if you need advanced state orchestration.

### Conclusion
> ‚úÖ **Yes, Azure Logic Apps can maintain state ‚Äî especially Logic Apps Standard, which is explicitly designed for stateful, long-running workflows.**  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Logic Apps Consumption has limited, platform-managed state and is better suited for short-lived, event-driven automations.
