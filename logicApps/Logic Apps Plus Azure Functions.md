Combining **Azure Logic Apps** and **Azure Functions** is a powerful strategy for building flexible, scalable, and maintainable workflows. Here are some compelling **use cases** where this combination shines:

---

### üîÑ 1. **Custom Data Transformation**
- **Logic App**: Orchestrates the workflow (e.g., receives a file or API request).
- **Function**: Performs complex data parsing, transformation, or enrichment (e.g., converting XML to JSON, applying business rules).

---

### üßæ 2. **Invoice Processing**
- **Logic App**: Triggers on new email with invoice attachment.
- **Function**: Extracts data from the invoice using OCR or regex and returns structured data.
- **Logic App**: Routes the data to a database or approval system.

---

### üîê 3. **Secure Token Generation**
- **Logic App**: Needs to call an external API that requires a dynamic token.
- **Function**: Generates or retrieves the token securely and returns it to the Logic App.

---

### üì¶ 4. **Batch Processing**
- **Logic App**: Triggers on a schedule or file drop.
- **Function**: Processes a batch of records (e.g., from a CSV or database) and returns results.
- **Logic App**: Sends notifications or stores the output.

---

### üß† 5. **AI/ML Integration**
- **Logic App**: Collects user input or telemetry data.
- **Function**: Calls a machine learning model or AI service to analyze or predict.
- **Logic App**: Acts on the result (e.g., alert, recommendation, routing).

---

### üìä 6. **Real-Time Event Handling**
- **Logic App**: Subscribes to an Event Grid or Service Bus topic.
- **Function**: Processes the event payload and performs custom logic.
- **Logic App**: Logs the result or triggers downstream systems.
