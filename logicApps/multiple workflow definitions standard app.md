Yes, with a **Standard Logic Apps plan**, you can absolutely run **multiple workflow definitions** within the same Logic App environment. This is one of the key advantages of the Standard hosting model.

### 🧱 How It Works

#### ✅ **Multi-Workflow Support**
- A **Standard Logic App** is essentially a container (like an Azure Function App) that can host **multiple workflows**.
- Each workflow can have:
  - Its own **triggers** (e.g., HTTP, Service Bus, Timer)
  - Its own **actions** and logic
  - Separate **state management**, **error handling**, and **logging**

#### 📁 Example Structure
```
MyLogicApp (Standard)
├── workflow1.json  → HTTP trigger, sends email
├── workflow2.json  → Timer trigger, processes data
├── workflow3.json  → Service Bus trigger, logs messages
```

### 🧠 Benefits of Multi-Workflow Setup

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Isolation** | Each workflow runs independently |
| **Efficiency** | Share resources (App Service Plan) across workflows |
| **Modularity** | Easier to manage and update workflows |
| **Cost-effective** | No need to provision separate Logic Apps for each workflow |

---

### 🧰 How to Manage in VS Code
- Use the **Logic Apps (Standard)** extension.
- Each workflow is a separate `.json` file under the `workflows/` folder.
- You can run, debug, and deploy them individually or as a group.
