When troubleshooting an **Azure Logic App workflow during runtime**, you have several powerful tools and techniques at your disposal. Here's a breakdown of your options:

---

### 🧭 **1. Run History (Azure Portal)**
- Navigate to your Logic App in the Azure Portal.
- Click on **“Runs history”** to see a list of recent executions.
- Each run shows:
  - **Status** (Succeeded, Failed, Skipped)
  - **Start time**
  - **Duration**
- Click on a run to **drill into each step** and view inputs, outputs, and errors.

---

### 🧪 **2. Step-by-Step Diagnostics**
- Within a run, you can:
  - View **trigger inputs** (e.g., HTTP request body).
  - Inspect **action outputs** (e.g., API responses).
  - See **error messages** and **stack traces** for failed steps.
- This helps pinpoint where and why a failure occurred.

---

### 🧰 **3. Enable Diagnostic Logging**
- Go to **Monitoring > Diagnostic settings**.
- Send logs to:
  - **Log Analytics** (for querying and dashboards)
  - **Storage Account** (for archiving)
  - **Event Hub** (for streaming to SIEM tools)
- Capture:
  - Workflow runtime logs
  - Trigger and action events
  - Errors and retries

---

### 📊 **4. Use Application Insights (Standard Logic Apps)**
- For **Standard Logic Apps**, you can enable **Application Insights**.
- Provides:
  - **Telemetry** (e.g., performance, dependencies)
  - **Custom logging**
  - **Live metrics**
  - **Distributed tracing**

---

### 🧱 **5. Retry Policies and Error Handling**
- Configure **retry policies** on actions to handle transient failures.
- Use **“Scope”** and **“Run After”** to build custom error handling paths.
- Add **“Terminate”**, **“Set Variable”**, or **“Send Email”** actions for alerts.

---

### 🧪 **6. Test with Static Inputs**
- Use the **“Run Trigger”** option in the portal to test with sample data.
- Helps validate logic without waiting for real events.

---

### 🧑‍💻 **7. Local Debugging (Standard Only)**
- For **Standard Logic Apps**, use **Visual Studio Code** with the Logic Apps extension.
- Run and debug workflows locally before deploying.
