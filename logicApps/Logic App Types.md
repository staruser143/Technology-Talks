Great observation! Yes, Azure Logic Apps offers **two hosting models**: **Consumption** and **Standard**. Here's a breakdown to help you decide which one to use:

---

### âš¡ **Consumption Logic Apps**
**Best for:** Lightweight, event-driven workflows with minimal infrastructure concerns.

#### âœ… Pros:
- **Pay-per-execution**: You only pay when your workflow runs.
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales based on demand.
- **Quick setup**: Easier to deploy and manage.
- **Ideal for simple integrations**: Like email triggers, file uploads, or notifications.

#### ðŸš« Limitations:
- Limited **custom code** and **local development** support.
- Less control over **networking** and **environment isolation**.
- Fewer **advanced features** (like built-in versioning or stateful workflows).

---

### ðŸ§± **Standard Logic Apps**
**Best for:** Complex, enterprise-grade workflows with advanced control and customization.

#### âœ… Pros:
- **Built on Azure Functions runtime**: Supports local development and CI/CD.
- **Stateful workflows**: Maintain state across executions.
- **Custom connectors and inline code**: More flexibility.
- **VNET integration**: Better security and networking options.
- **Built-in versioning and debugging tools**

#### ðŸš« Considerations:
- **Pricing** is based on compute and storage, not per execution.
- Requires more setup and management.
- May be overkill for simple workflows.
