This is a classic event-driven system problem that involves managing a waiting period, sending timed reminders, and handling a timeout. Here are a few approaches you could take, along with their pros and cons.

### Approach 1: Event-Driven with a Scheduled Job

This is a very common and robust approach.

**How it works:**

1.  **Submission Event:** When an application is submitted, a `APPLICATION_SUBMITTED` event is published to a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS).
2.  **Processing Service:** A service consumes this event. If the application is from an agent, it:
    * Saves the application to a database with a status of `PENDING_AGENT_SIGNATURE`.
    * Sends the initial signature request email to the agent.
    * Schedules a future event for the timeout. This can be done by sending a message to a "delay queue" or by scheduling a job in a dedicated scheduler (like Quartz, Airflow, or even a simple cron job).
3.  **Scheduled Reminders:** You have a scheduled job that runs daily (or every few hours). This job:
    * Queries the database for applications with `PENDING_AGENT_SIGNATURE` status.
    * For each application, it checks the submission date and sends reminder emails on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th days.
    * The job needs to be idempotent—it should only send an email if one hasn't been sent for that specific day.
4.  **Timeout Handling:**
    * You can have another scheduled job that runs daily. It queries the database for applications that have been in `PENDING_AGENT_SIGNATURE` for more than 12 days.
    * For these applications, it updates the status to `PENDING_APPROVAL` and publishes a new `APPLICATION_TIMEOUT` event.
5.  **Agent Signature Event:** When the agent signs the application, the web app publishes an `AGENT_SIGNED` event.
    * A service consumes this event, updates the application status to `READY_FOR_PROCESSING`, and publishes a new `APPLICATION_READY` event to start the next phase of processing.

**Pros:**

* **Decoupled:** The system is highly decoupled. Services don't need to know about each other's state directly.
* **Scalable:** You can scale the services independently.
* **Robust:** If a service fails, the messages remain in the queue and can be reprocessed.
* **Clear State Management:** The database is the single source of truth for the application's state.

**Cons:**

* **Complexity:** Requires a message queue, a scheduler, and multiple services.
* **Potential for Race Conditions:** You need to handle concurrency carefully to avoid multiple services processing the same application at the same time.

### Approach 2: Using a State Machine (e.g., AWS Step Functions)

This approach is excellent for managing complex workflows with clear states and transitions.

**How it works:**

1.  **Start the State Machine:** The initial application submission event triggers a new execution of a state machine.
2.  **Wait State:** The state machine starts and enters a `Wait` state for 3 days.
3.  **Reminder Task:** After 3 days, it transitions to a `Task` state that sends the first reminder email.
4.  **Wait and Remind Loop:** The workflow continues in a loop of `Wait` states and `Task` states for each reminder (5, 7, 9, 11 days).
5.  **Signature Awaited:** The state machine also waits for an external event—the agent's signature. This is often handled by a "callback token" pattern where the state machine pauses and waits for a specific token to be returned by an external service (the web app or signature service).
6.  **Conditional Transitions:**
    * **Signature Received:** If the `AGENT_SIGNED` event with the callback token is received, the state machine transitions to the `PROCESSING` state and ends the flow.
    * **Timeout:** If the total time (12 days) elapses without the signature, the state machine transitions to the `TIMEOUT` state. In this state, it performs a task to update the application status to `PENDING_APPROVAL` and ends the flow.

**Pros:**

* **Visibility:** You get a visual representation of your workflow, making it easy to understand and debug.
* **Managed State:** The state machine service handles all the state transitions, waiting periods, and retries for you.
* **Reduced Boilerplate:** You don't have to write code for the timing, retries, or state management logic.
* **Auditing:** Provides detailed execution logs for every step.

**Cons:**

* **Vendor Lock-in:** Tightly coupled to the specific state machine service (e.g., AWS Step Functions, Azure Logic Apps).
* **Cost:** The service usage can incur costs based on the number of state transitions and execution time.

### Approach 3: Using a Database-Driven "Scheduler"

This is a simpler, but potentially less scalable, approach for smaller systems.

**How it works:**

1.  **Submission:** When an agent application is submitted, you insert a record into a database table. This record includes `application_id`, `status` (`PENDING_AGENT_SIGNATURE`), `submission_timestamp`, and a `next_action_timestamp`.
2.  **Initial Action:** The application is submitted, you send the first email, and set `next_action_timestamp` to 3 days from now.
3.  **Polling Job:** A single, lightweight microservice or cron job runs every few minutes.
    * It queries the database for applications where `status` is `PENDING_AGENT_SIGNATURE` and `next_action_timestamp` is less than or equal to the current time.
    * For each found record, it performs the required action:
        * **Reminders:** If it's the 3rd, 5th, etc., day, it sends the reminder email and updates `next_action_timestamp` to the next reminder date.
        * **Timeout:** If it's beyond the 12th day, it updates the status to `PENDING_APPROVAL`.
4.  **Agent Signature:** When the agent signs, the web app directly updates the application record's `status` to `READY_FOR_PROCESSING`.

**Pros:**

* **Simple to Implement:** Less infrastructure is needed (no message queue or dedicated scheduler).
* **Direct:** The logic is straightforward and contained.

**Cons:**

* **Not Scalable:** The polling job can become a performance bottleneck as the number of pending applications grows.
* **Chatty:** The polling creates a constant load on the database.
* **Single Point of Failure:** If the single polling service fails, the entire process stalls.
* **Less Decoupled:** The web app and the polling service both need direct database access.

### Recommendation

For your scenario, the **Event-Driven with a Scheduled Job (Approach 1)** is generally the most recommended and scalable solution for a production system. It's a best-practice pattern that provides a good balance of robustness, scalability, and maintainability.

However, if you are operating within a cloud environment like AWS, Azure, or GCP, **using a State Machine (Approach 2)** can be an even better choice. It abstracts away a lot of the complexity of managing timings and state, allowing you to focus on the business logic.

The database-driven approach is a good starting point for a simple system but should be considered a temporary solution until the system grows in scale.
