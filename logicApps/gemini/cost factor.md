The cost factor is often the most significant driver in deciding between Azure Logic Apps Consumption and Standard, and by extension, whether to consider an App Service Environment (ASEv3). It's not a simple comparison, as different components contribute to the overall cost, and usage patterns heavily influence which plan is more economical.
Let's break down the cost considerations:
1. Logic Apps Consumption Pricing Model
 * Pay-per-execution (Serverless): This is the core of Consumption pricing. You pay for what you use, making it very cost-effective for low or infrequent workloads.
 * Cost Components:
   * Actions: You are billed per action execution. The first 4,000 actions per month per Azure subscription are often free. After that, each action incurs a small charge (e.g., ~$0.000025 per action).
   * Triggers: Each time a trigger fires and checks for new data, it's counted as an execution, even if it doesn't result in a workflow run (e.g., a polling trigger checking every minute).
   * Standard Connectors: These are generally low-cost, billed per call (e.g., ~$0.000125 per call).
   * Enterprise Connectors: These are more expensive, billed per call (e.g., ~$0.001 per call). They are used for high-value services like SAP, IBM MQ, etc.
   * Integration Account (Critical for B2B): If your Consumption Logic App needs B2B capabilities (EDI, AS2, X12, XML schemas/maps), you must provision an Integration Account. This is a significant fixed monthly cost, regardless of usage. Tiers are Basic and Standard, with prices varying (e.g., Basic might be around $277 USD/month, Standard much higher, around $913 USD/month - always check the official Azure pricing page for the latest figures and region-specific prices). This fixed cost is often the tipping point that makes Consumption more expensive than Standard for B2B scenarios.
   * Storage: Stateful workflows incur storage transaction costs as they write inputs and outputs to Azure Storage. This is usually a small component unless you're processing very large messages at high volumes.
   * Other Azure Services: If your Logic App calls other Azure services (Azure Functions, Service Bus, Storage, Event Hubs), those services are billed separately based on their respective pricing models.
When Consumption is Cheaper:
 * Low Volume / Infrequent Workloads: If your Logic Apps run only a few times a day, or have very low action counts, the pay-per-execution model is highly economical.
 * No B2B/Advanced XML: If you don't need an Integration Account.
 * Prototypes and Development: Easy to get started with minimal upfront cost.
2. Logic Apps Standard Pricing Model
 * Reserved Capacity (App Service Plan): The primary cost for Standard Logic Apps comes from the underlying App Service Plan (ASP). You pay for the compute resources (VM instances) you provision, regardless of whether your Logic Apps are running or not.
 * Cost Components:
   * App Service Plan: You choose a tier (e.g., WS1, WS2, WS3, equivalent to PremiumV2/V3 App Service plans). This is a fixed monthly cost per instance. For example, a P1v3 might cost around $240 USD/month. You scale out by adding more instances.
     * Important: You can host multiple Logic App (Standard) resources and multiple workflows within a single App Service Plan. This allows for cost consolidation.
   * Managed Connector Calls: While built-in connectors are generally free within the ASP's compute, calls to managed connectors (Standard and Enterprise) are still billed per call, similar to Consumption. However, Built-in versions of connectors (e.g., Service Bus, SQL Server) run in-process and leverage the ASP's compute, thus often reducing costs for those operations.
   * Integration Account (Conditional):
     * For Schemas/Maps/Assemblies: You do not need a separate Integration Account if you only need to use schemas, maps, or .NET assemblies. These can be deployed directly with your Standard Logic App project, saving the fixed monthly Integration Account cost.
     * For Partners/Agreements (AS2, X12, EDIFACT): If you require the full B2B partner and agreement management features (like AS2, X12, EDIFACT), you will still need an Integration Account. This will add its fixed monthly cost on top of your App Service Plan cost.
   * Storage: Stateful workflows in Standard Logic Apps still incur storage costs for persisting state, similar to Consumption. Stateless workflows incur much lower (or negligible) storage costs as they don't persist state.
   * Networking: Costs associated with VNet integration (e.g., data transfer, NAT Gateway if used) can apply.
   * Other Azure Services: As with Consumption, other Azure services consumed are billed separately.
When Standard is Cheaper:
 * Consistent, High Volume Workloads: If your Logic Apps run very frequently with high action counts, the fixed cost of an App Service Plan can quickly become more economical than the per-action billing of Consumption.
 * B2B/Advanced XML without Partners/Agreements: If you only need schemas, maps, or assemblies, Standard allows you to avoid the Integration Account cost, making it significantly cheaper than Consumption for these scenarios.
 * Consolidation: If you have many Logic Apps that can share a single App Service Plan.
 * Predictable Budgeting: Fixed monthly App Service Plan cost allows for easier budgeting.
3. App Service Environment v3 (ASEv3) Pricing Model
 * Highest Cost for Highest Isolation/Scale: ASEv3 is the most expensive option, but it provides unparalleled network isolation, security, and scale.
 * Cost Components:
   * ASEv3 "Stamp Fee" / Minimum Charge: ASEv3 has a fixed hourly charge for the environment itself, even if no App Service Plans are running inside it (though if you have at least one I1v2 instance running, this minimum charge is covered by the cost of that instance). This is a substantial fixed cost (e.g., around $0.42 USD/hour or $310 USD/month for an empty ASE, but check current pricing).
   * IsolatedV2 App Service Plans: Within an ASEv3, you create App Service Plans using the IsolatedV2 tier. These plans are also billed per instance, similar to other ASPs, but at a higher rate due to the dedicated, isolated infrastructure.
   * Managed Connector Calls: Same as Standard Logic Apps.
   * Storage & Networking: Similar to Standard, but potentially higher networking costs due to more complex VNet configurations.
   * Other Azure Services: Billed separately.
When ASEv3 is Cheaper (relatively):
 * Very Large Scale Consolidation: If you are running hundreds of App Service applications (including many Logic Apps Standard) that can all benefit from the shared, isolated infrastructure, the cost per app can eventually become lower than running them on separate high-tier App Service Plans outside an ASE.
 * Mandatory Network Isolation/Compliance: When the security and compliance requirements are so stringent that an ASE is the only viable option, cost becomes secondary to meeting those requirements.
General Cost Optimization Tips
 * Azure Pricing Calculator: Always use the Azure Pricing Calculator to get detailed estimates for your specific usage scenarios. This is the most accurate way to compare costs.
 * Reserved Instances/Savings Plans: For App Service Plans (Standard and ASEv3), consider purchasing Azure Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for compute to get significant discounts (up to 40% or more) for 1 or 3-year commitments.
 * Monitor Usage: Regularly monitor your Logic App and App Service Plan usage to identify areas for optimization.
 * Choose Right Connectors: Prioritize built-in connectors in Standard Logic Apps where possible to reduce managed connector call costs.
 * Stateless Workflows (Standard): For high-volume, short-lived tasks, stateless workflows in Standard Logic Apps can significantly reduce storage transaction costs.
 * Consolidate (Standard): Host multiple Logic App (Standard) resources and workflows on a single App Service Plan to maximize resource utilization and amortize the fixed ASP cost.
In essence, Consumption offers a low entry barrier and scales well for low, unpredictable usage without B2B. Standard becomes more economical and feature-rich for consistent, higher-volume workloads, especially if you can avoid the Integration Account by using native schema/map support. ASEv3 is the premium choice for the most demanding security, isolation, and massive scale requirements, where its fixed cost is justified by consolidating a very large number of critical applications.
