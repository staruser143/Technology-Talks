do we also need the azure cli to be installed for this

# response
Great question!

**Do you *need* Azure CLI to use Azure Logic Apps Standard?**  
üëâ **No ‚Äî it's not strictly required**, but **it is highly recommended** for full functionality, automation, and deployment flexibility.

Let‚Äôs break this down:

---

### ‚úÖ When You **Don‚Äôt Need** Azure CLI

You can accomplish **basic development and deployment** without installing Azure CLI by using:

#### 1. **Visual Studio Code + Azure Extensions**
- Create, design, and deploy Logic Apps directly from VS Code using the **Azure Logic Apps (Standard)** extension.
- Sign in to Azure via the GUI.
- Deploy with a right-click ("Deploy to Azure").
- Browse resources, monitor runs, and manage settings ‚Äî all from the VS Code UI.

‚úÖ No Azure CLI needed.

#### 2. **Azure Portal**
- You can create the Logic App resource, storage account, and connections directly in the Azure portal.
- Use **Logic App Designer in the portal** (though limited compared to VS Code for Standard).

‚úÖ No CLI required.

### ‚úÖ When You **Do Benefit From (or Need)** Azure CLI

While not mandatory, **Azure CLI becomes essential or highly useful** in these scenarios:

#### 1. **Automated Deployment (CI/CD)**
- In pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps), you often use CLI commands like:
  ```bash
  az login
  az logicapp deployment source config-zip
  ```
- CLI is the standard way to script deployments.

üîπ **Recommended to install CLI in CI environments.**

#### 2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- If using **Bicep** or **ARM templates**, you‚Äôll often deploy them using:
  ```bash
  az deployment group create --template-file main.bicep --resource-group my-rg
  ```
- CLI is the primary tool for this.

#### 3. **Managing Resources Programmatically**
- Create resource groups, storage accounts, app service plans, etc., via script.
- Example:
  ```bash
  az group create --name my-logicapp-rg --location eastus
  az storage account create --name mystorage --resource-group my-logicapp-rg --location eastus --sku Standard_LRS
  ```

#### 4. **Authentication & Service Principals**
- For non-interactive (headless) automation, you often use:
  ```bash
  az login --service-principal -u <app-id> -p <password> --tenant <tenant-id>
  ```

#### 5. **Troubleshooting & Diagnostics**
- Fetch logs, check deployment status, list resources:
  ```bash
  az logicapp log tail --name my-logic-app --resource-group my-rg
  az webapp deployment list --name my-logic-app --resource-group my-rg
  ```

### ‚úÖ Summary: Do You Need Azure CLI?

| Scenario | Required? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Local dev with VS Code | ‚ùå No | GUI tools handle login and deploy |
| Deploy via VS Code right-click | ‚ùå No | Uses underlying SDKs |
| Use CI/CD pipelines | ‚úÖ Yes (recommended) | CLI is standard in automation |
| Use Bicep/ARM templates | ‚úÖ Yes | `az deployment` is the main command |
| Automate resource creation | ‚úÖ Yes | CLI or PowerShell preferred |
| Full DevOps workflow | ‚úÖ Yes | CLI integrates best with scripts |

### ‚úÖ Recommendation

üëâ **Install Azure CLI anyway**, even if you're starting with VS Code.

It gives you:
- Greater control
- Automation capabilities
- Consistency across teams and pipelines
- Better alignment with Azure best practices

üí° **Pro Tip**: You can use **Azure PowerShell** as an alternative to CLI, but CLI is more widely used, especially in cross-platform and CI/CD scenarios.
