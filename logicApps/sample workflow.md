Hereâ€™s a **sample Azure Logic Apps workflow** to help you visualize how it works. Letâ€™s take a common use case:

---

### ðŸ“§ **Scenario**: Automatically Save Email Attachments to OneDrive

**Goal**: When a new email arrives in your Outlook inbox with an attachment, save the attachment to a specific OneDrive folder.

---

### ðŸ”„ **Workflow Steps**:

1. **Trigger**:  
   - **When a new email arrives (V3)**  
   - Service: Outlook 365  
   - Filter: Only emails with attachments

2. **Condition (Optional)**:  
   - Check if the subject contains specific keywords (e.g., "Invoice")

3. **Action**:  
   - **Get Attachment**  
   - Retrieve the file(s) from the email

4. **Action**:  
   - **Create File in OneDrive**  
   - Save the attachment to a designated folder like `/Invoices/2025/`
