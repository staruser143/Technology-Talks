## üìù Proposal: Migrating Post-Enrollment Workflow to Azure Logic Apps

### 1. **Executive Summary**
This proposal outlines the migration of the existing post-enrollment workflow‚Äîcurrently powered by a mix of batch and real-time jobs‚Äîto a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution using **Azure Logic Apps**. The goal is to streamline operations, improve integration capabilities, and reduce operational overhead.

---

### 2. **Current Workflow Overview**
- **Batch Jobs**: Scheduled tasks for data synchronization, reporting, and archival.
- **Real-Time Jobs**: Triggered by user actions or system events (e.g., notifications, API calls).
- **Integration Points**: CRM systems, databases, file storage, and external APIs.

---

### 3. **Challenges in the Current System**
- High maintenance due to custom code and scripts.
- Limited scalability and monitoring.
- Complex error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Manual integration with external systems.

### 4. **Proposed Azure Logic Apps Architecture**

![Post-Enrollment Workflow Migration to Azure Logic Apps](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/a16ab569-fd6d-44fe-8904-c8cf8afaccb6)

#### Key Components:
- **Triggers**:
  - HTTP Trigger for real-time API calls.
  - Timer Trigger for scheduled batch jobs.
- **Logic Apps**:
  - Modular workflows for notifications, data sync, and external integrations.
- **Connectors**:
  - SQL Database, Blob Storage, Email.
- **Custom Logic**:
  - Azure Functions for business rules and transformations.
- **External Systems**:
  - CRM and third-party APIs.

### 5. **Benefits of Azure Logic Apps**
| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Low-Code Development** | Rapid workflow creation and updates |
| **Scalability** | Auto-scaling based on demand |
| **Built-in Connectors** | 600+ connectors for seamless integration |
| **Monitoring & Alerts** | Native diagnostics and logging |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Pay-per-use model |

---

### 6. **Migration Strategy**

#### **Phase 1: Real-Time Workflow Migration**
- Migrate API-triggered workflows to Logic Apps.
- Integrate with Azure Functions for custom logic.

#### **Phase 2: Batch Workflow Migration**
- Replace scheduled jobs with Timer-triggered Logic Apps.
- Move data operations to SQL and Blob connectors.

#### **Phase 3: External System Integration**
- Use Logic Apps connectors for CRM and third-party APIs.
- Implement retry and error handling policies.

#### **Phase 4: Optimization & Monitoring**
- Set up Application Insights and alerts.
- Review performance and cost metrics.

---

### 7. **Conclusion**
Migrating to Azure Logic Apps will modernize the post-enrollment workflow, reduce complexity, and enhance integration capabilities. This approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and operational efficiency.
