The **Azure Functions runtime** is the underlying engine that powers **Standard Logic Apps**, and this relationship brings several key benefits and capabilities.

### ðŸ”— Relationship Overview

#### **1. Shared Runtime**
- **Standard Logic Apps** are built on the **same runtime as Azure Functions**.
- This means they inherit features like:
  - Local development
  - Custom handlers
  - Durable workflows
  - Rich debugging and logging

#### **2. Local Development & CI/CD**
- You can develop Standard Logic Apps using **Visual Studio Code** with the **Azure Functions extension**.
- This enables:
  - Local testing
  - Source control integration
  - CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps

#### **3. Hosting Model**
- Standard Logic Apps run in the **App Service Environment (ASE)** or **dedicated hosting plans**, similar to Azure Functions.
- You can control scaling, networking, and environment isolation.

#### **4. Extensibility**
- You can embed **Azure Functions** directly into Logic Apps workflows.
- This allows you to write custom code for:
  - Data transformation
  - Business logic
  - External API calls
