#### ðŸ§° **Software Requirements**
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Visual Studio Code | Main development environment |
| Azure CLI | For managing Azure resources from the terminal |
| .NET SDK (6.0+) | Required for Azure Functions runtime |
| Node.js (LTS) | Required for some extensions and tools |
| Azure Functions Core Tools | To run Logic Apps locally (Standard only) |

   - Choose a folder, language (JavaScript or C#), and workflow type.

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Use `F5` or `npm start` to run the Logic App locally.
   - It uses the **Azure Functions runtime** under the hood.

3. **Deploy to Azure**:
   - Right-click the project folder â†’ `Deploy to Logic App (Standard)`
   - Or use the Azure CLI:  
     ```bash
     az logicapp deployment source config-zip \
       --name <logic-app-name> \
       --resource-group <resource-group> \
       --src <path-to-zip>
     ```

### ðŸ§  Notes:
- **Consumption Logic Apps** do not support local development. You manage them via the Azure Portal or IaC (e.g., Terraform, Bicep).
- **Standard Logic Apps** are ideal for local dev, CI/CD, and advanced scenarios.
