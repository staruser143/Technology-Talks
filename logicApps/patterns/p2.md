Great ‚Äî based on your use cases, Azure Logic Apps is a strong fit, as it supports all the patterns you need using its built-in connectors, hybrid capabilities, and integration triggers. Below is a mapping of your use cases to Logic App patterns and features, along with notes for each:


---

‚úÖ 1. Triggering Batch and Real-Time Jobs

Pattern	Logic App Support

Scheduled Triggers (Batch)	Use Recurrence trigger to run jobs on cron/schedule.
Event-Based Triggers (Real-Time)	Use HTTP, Event Grid, Service Bus, Event Hub, or Blob triggers to fire jobs on demand or on events.
Invoke Azure Functions / WebJobs / APIs	Trigger external batch/real-time compute via REST/API call.
‚úÖ Supported	‚úîÔ∏è Fully supported via schedule and event triggers with connectors.



---

‚úÖ 2. Reading/Writing Data to MongoDB (Atlas or Self-hosted)

Pattern	Logic App Support

Direct Integration	No native MongoDB connector, but:
‚Üí Use Azure Functions or Custom REST API to wrap MongoDB access.	
‚Üí Securely invoke those from Logic Apps.	
‚Üí Use API Management as a gateway if needed.	
Data Change Trigger (CDC)	Use Change Streams with custom service (e.g., in AKS or Function App), which then calls a Logic App via webhook or Service Bus.
‚úÖ Supported with Custom Wrappers	‚úîÔ∏è Needs intermediary like Azure Function or API.



---

‚úÖ 3. Sending Reminder Emails Periodically and Conditionally

Pattern	Logic App Support

Recurring Triggers	Use Recurrence trigger.
Conditional Logic	Use If, Switch, expressions, or call external API to evaluate conditions.
Email Connectors	Use Outlook, Office365, Gmail, or SMTP connectors to send emails.
‚úÖ Fully Supported	‚úîÔ∏è Native functionality. Can integrate with DB/API for context.



---

‚úÖ 4. Secure File Transfer over SFTP

Pattern	Logic App Support

SFTP Connectors	Use built-in SFTP-SSH connector for read/write/move/delete operations.
PGP Decryption/Encryption	Use Azure Functions or Logic App inline scripts for file processing.
Monitoring for File Arrival	Use When a file is added or modified trigger.
‚úÖ Fully Supported	‚úîÔ∏è SFTP is a first-class connector. Add retry, delay, and archive patterns if needed.



---

‚úÖ 5. Integration with SOA / REST APIs

Pattern	Logic App Support

SOAP	Use HTTP action with custom headers and XML body, or wrap SOAP in Azure Functions.
REST	Use HTTP or any REST-based connector.
Authentication	Supports OAuth2, Basic Auth, API key headers, Managed Identity, etc.
‚úÖ Fully Supported	‚úîÔ∏è Secure and flexible integration with APIs.



---

‚úÖ 6. Connecting to On-Prem and AWS Workloads

Pattern	Logic App Support

On-Prem	Use On-premises data gateway to access on-prem DB, file shares, SAP, Oracle, etc.
AWS Workloads	Trigger AWS Lambda/APIs via HTTP, integrate with S3/SQS via standard HTTP or custom connectors.
Hybrid Security	Use VNet integration, Private Link, and Hybrid Connections if needed.
‚úÖ Supported	‚úîÔ∏è Hybrid access possible with secure connectivity.



---

‚úÖ 7. Triggering Workflows on Schedule

Pattern	Logic App Support

Recurring Trigger	Use the Recurrence trigger to schedule daily, hourly, weekly jobs.
‚úÖ Fully Supported	‚úîÔ∏è Simple cron-like triggers with timezone support.



---

‚úÖ 8. Triggering Workflows via Events

Pattern	Logic App Support

Event Grid	Trigger on blob creation, resource events, or custom topics.
Service Bus / Event Hub	Trigger on message or event arrival.
Custom Webhook Events	Use HTTP Request trigger.
‚úÖ Fully Supported	‚úîÔ∏è Event-driven orchestration is a core use case.



---

‚úÖ 9. Triggering Based on Data Changes in MongoDB

Pattern	Logic App Support

Change Data Capture (CDC)	No built-in MongoDB CDC trigger. However:
‚Üí Implement MongoDB Change Stream Listener (e.g., in Azure Function or AKS).	
‚Üí On change, emit event via HTTP call, Event Grid, or Service Bus to Logic App.	
‚úÖ Supported via Custom Service	‚úîÔ∏è Needs a MongoDB change stream processor to push changes to Logic App.



---

üîÑ Recommendation: Hybrid Architecture for MongoDB Use Cases

Since MongoDB does not have a native Logic App connector or change trigger:

1. Use a Node.js/NestJS/Azure Function-based listener for MongoDB Change Streams.


2. Emit events or HTTP triggers to Logic Apps for downstream orchestration (e.g., email, file, API).


3. For CRUD operations, wrap DB access in an Azure Function or expose via a secure API gateway.
