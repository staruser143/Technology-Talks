Hereâ€™s a **sample Azure Logic App workflow** that triggers both **real-time** and **batch jobs**. I'll describe each and then show a visual representation.

### ðŸ”„ **Real-Time Job Triggering Workflow**
**Scenario**: A new customer order is received via an HTTP request, and the Logic App:
1. Validates the order.
2. Sends a confirmation email.
3. Triggers an Azure Function to update inventory.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[HTTP Request - New Order] --> B[Azure Logic App]
    B --> C[Validate Order]
    C --> D[Send Confirmation Email]
    C --> E[Trigger Azure Function - Update Inventory]
```

### ðŸ•’ **Batch Job Triggering Workflow**
**Scenario**: Every night at 2 AM, the Logic App:
1. Triggers a Data Factory pipeline to aggregate sales data.
2. Sends a summary report via email.
3. Logs the job status to a database.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Recurrence Trigger - 2 AM Daily] --> B[Azure Logic App]
    B --> C[Trigger Data Factory Pipeline]
    C --> D[Send Summary Email]
    C --> E[Log Status to SQL Database]
```
