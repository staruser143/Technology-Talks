Great question!

The reason there are **multiple Azure Logic Apps icons** in the diagram is to visually represent **different instances or roles** of Logic Apps within the architecture. Here's the breakdown:

### ðŸ§© Why Multiple Logic Apps Icons?

1. **Trigger Points**:
   - Each trigger (HTTP, Timer, API call) is shown connecting to a **separate Logic App icon** to indicate that **different workflows** may be initiated by different events.

2. **Connector Interactions**:
   - Some Logic Apps icons are placed near connectors (like SQL, Email, CRM) to show that **Logic Apps orchestrate those integrations**.
   - This helps clarify that Logic Apps are the **central integration engine**, even if it's a **single workflow** or **multiple modular workflows**.

3. **Visual Clarity**:
   - Using multiple icons avoids clutter and overlapping lines, making the diagram easier to read and understand.

### âœ… What It Actually Means

In practice, you might have:
- A **single Logic App** with multiple triggers and actions.
- Or, **modular Logic Apps**, each handling a specific part of the workflow (e.g., one for notifications, one for data sync).
