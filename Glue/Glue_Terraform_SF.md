### Query:
How to use Native AWS Glue Connector for Salesfroce?

### Response:

To use the **AWS Glue Salesforce Connector** (from AWS Marketplace), you should:

1. **Create a Glue Connection** of type `MARKETPLACE` (not `JDBC`).
2. **Specify the Salesforce Connector ARN** in the connection properties.
3. **Provide OAuth parameters** as required by the connector.

Here’s an example of how to provision a Glue Connection using the Salesforce AWS Glue Connector:

````hcl
resource "aws_glue_connection" "salesforce_marketplace" {
  name = "salesforce-marketplace-connection"
  connection_type = "MARKETPLACE"

  connection_properties = {
    CONNECTOR_URL         = "arn:aws:aws-glue:us-east-1:123456789012:connector/salesforce"
    CONNECTION_NAME       = "salesforce-marketplace-connection"
    SFDC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID  = var.salesforce_client_id
    SFDC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = var.salesforce_client_secret
    SFDC_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN = var.salesforce_refresh_token
    SFDC_LOGIN_URL        = "https://login.salesforce.com"
    SFDC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = var.salesforce_redirect_uri
    # Add other required properties as per connector documentation
  }

  physical_connection_requirements {
    availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
    security_group_id_list = [aws_security_group.glue.id]
    subnet_id              = aws_subnet.glue.id
  }
}
````

**Key differences:**
- Uses `connection_type = "MARKETPLACE"`
- Uses `CONNECTOR_URL` with the Salesforce connector ARN
- Uses OAuth-specific properties required by the Salesforce Glue Connector

**Summary:**  
The previous script does **not** use the AWS Glue Salesforce Connector. Use the above pattern to provision a connection with the marketplace connector. Always refer to the [official AWS Glue Salesforce Connector documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/connector-salesforce.html) for the latest required properties.

### Query: 
Is it the native connector avaialble in Glue for Salesforce and is it free or paid?

### Response: 
The **AWS Glue Salesforce Connector** available in Glue Studio is a **native connector** provided via the AWS Marketplace. It is **not free**—you are charged based on the connector’s pricing in the AWS Marketplace, in addition to standard Glue job costs.

**Summary:**
- **Native?** Yes, available directly in Glue Studio via AWS Marketplace.
- **Free?** No, it is a paid connector. Pricing details are shown in the AWS Marketplace listing for the Salesforce Glue Connector.

### Query:
Does that mean we should first subscribe/buy the connector first in the marketplace and then use the connector while creating the Glue Connection in Terraform script

### Response:
Yes, that is correct.

**Before** you can use the AWS Glue Salesforce Connector in your Terraform script, you must:

1. **Subscribe to the connector** in the AWS Marketplace (usually a one-time action per account/region).
2. **Accept any terms and conditions** required by the connector.
3. **Then** you can reference the connector’s ARN in your Terraform script when creating the Glue Connection.

**Summary:**  
Subscription in the AWS Marketplace is required before provisioning and using the connector in Glue via Terraform.

### Query:
How do I get the client_id,client_secret,refresh_token,login_url and redirect_url which are required to be provided as connection properties for provisioning Glue Connection.

### Response:
To obtain the required Salesforce OAuth credentials for the AWS Glue Salesforce Connector, follow these steps:

### 1. **Create a Salesforce Connected App**
- In Salesforce, go to **Setup** → **App Manager** → **New Connected App**.
- Fill in the **Basic Information**.
- Under **API (Enable OAuth Settings)**:
  - Check **Enable OAuth Settings**.
  - Set the **Callback URL** (this will be your `redirect_url`).
  - Select required **OAuth Scopes** (e.g., `Full access (full)`, `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`).

### 2. **Get the Client ID and Client Secret**
- After saving the Connected App, go to its details page.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are displayed there.

### 3. **Get the Refresh Token**
- Use a tool like **Postman** or a simple script to perform the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow:
  - Direct your browser to the Salesforce OAuth authorization URL:
    ```
    https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
    ```
  - Log in and authorize the app. You’ll be redirected to your `redirect_uri` with a `code` parameter.
  - Exchange the code for a refresh token using a POST request to:
    ```
    https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
    ```
    With body parameters:
    - `grant_type=authorization_code`
    - `code=CODE_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP`
    - `client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID`
    - `client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`
  - The response will include the `refresh_token`.

### 4. **Login URL**
- Use `https://login.salesforce.com` for production or `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandbox.

### 5. **Redirect URL**
- This is the **Callback URL** you set in the Connected App.

**Summary Table:**

| Property         | How to Obtain                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| client_id        | From Salesforce Connected App details                              |
| client_secret    | From Salesforce Connected App details                              |
| refresh_token    | Obtained via OAuth flow (see step 3 above)                        |
| login_url        | Usually `https://login.salesforce.com` or `https://test.salesforce.com` |
| redirect_url     | The Callback URL set in Connected App                             |

**Tip:**  
Keep these credentials secure. Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to manage them in production.

### Query:
Should we do these steps as one time initial manual setup process and after that based on the obtained values from them use them in Terraform script accordingly.

### Response: Yes, exactly.  
These steps (creating the Connected App and obtaining the OAuth credentials) are a **one-time initial manual setup**. Once you have the required values (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `login_url`, `redirect_url`), you can use them in your Terraform script to provision the Glue Connection.

For automation and security, store these values in a secure location (like AWS Secrets Manager) and reference them in your Terraform code as needed.

### Query:
When the refresh_token expires what should we repeat the same steps again to obtain another refresh_token

### Response:
When a **refresh token** expires or is revoked, you must repeat the OAuth authorization flow to obtain a new refresh token:

1. **Re-authorize** the Salesforce Connected App (visit the authorization URL, log in, and approve access).
2. **Exchange the new authorization code** for a new refresh token.

**You do not need to recreate the Connected App**—just repeat the authorization steps to get a new refresh token.

**Tip:**  
Refresh tokens in Salesforce typically do not expire unless revoked or the user changes their password or revokes app access. Monitor for authentication failures and have a process to re-authorize if needed.

### Query: 
What is Redirect URL used for in the initial setup procss

### Response: 
The **Redirect URL** (also called **Callback URL**) is used in the OAuth authorization flow. After a user successfully logs in and authorizes your Salesforce Connected App, Salesforce redirects the user’s browser to this URL, appending an authorization code as a query parameter.

You then use this authorization code to obtain access and refresh tokens. The Redirect URL must match exactly what you set in the Connected App configuration for security reasons.

### Query:
What oAuth mode does this flow follow?

### Response:
This flow follows the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant** flow.

- The user is redirected to Salesforce to log in and authorize the app.
- Salesforce redirects back to the specified Redirect URL with an authorization code.
- The app exchanges the authorization code for an access token and a refresh token.

This is the standard and most secure OAuth flow for server-side applications.

### Query:
Does the connected app created in Salesforce have any specifc URL which is needed when doing the initial setup process.

### Response:
No, the Salesforce Connected App itself does **not** have a specific URL that you need for the OAuth setup process.

**What you need:**
- The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Connected App’s details page.
- The **Redirect URL** you configured in the Connected App.
- The **Salesforce OAuth endpoints** (e.g., `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize` and `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`).

**Summary:**  
You do **not** need a special URL for the Connected App itself—just use the standard Salesforce OAuth endpoints and the credentials from your Connected App.

Query:
In terraform script, does the connector_url refer to the ARN of the connector which was subscribed in aws marketplace.

Response:
Yes, in your Terraform script, the `connector_url` (or `CONNECTOR_URL` in `connection_properties`) should be set to the **ARN of the AWS Glue Salesforce Connector** that you subscribed to in the AWS Marketplace.

**Example:**
````hcl
connection_properties = {
  CONNECTOR_URL = "arn:aws:aws-glue:us-east-1:123456789012:connector/salesforce"
  # ...other properties...
}
````

You can find the connector ARN in the AWS Glue Studio UI or in the AWS Marketplace subscription details after subscribing.

### Query:
What is the difference between using AWS Glue Salesforce Connector and using JDBC connection to Salesforce.

### Response:
Here’s a concise comparison:

### **AWS Glue Salesforce Connector**
- **Type:** Native, managed connector available via AWS Marketplace.
- **Setup:** Subscribe in Marketplace, create a Glue Connection of type `MARKETPLACE`.
- **Authentication:** Supports OAuth natively.
- **Features:** Optimized for Salesforce, supports bulk APIs, better performance, schema inference, and error handling.
- **Maintenance:** AWS manages the connector updates and compatibility.
- **Cost:** Additional charges apply (Marketplace pricing).

### **JDBC Connection to Salesforce**
- **Type:** Generic JDBC connection using a third-party Salesforce JDBC driver (e.g., Simba, Progress).
- **Setup:** Upload and manage the JDBC driver JARs yourself (e.g., in S3), create a Glue Connection of type `JDBC`.
- **Authentication:** May support OAuth, but setup is manual and can be complex.
- **Features:** Limited to what the JDBC driver supports; may not support Salesforce bulk APIs or advanced features.
- **Maintenance:** You are responsible for driver updates and compatibility.
- **Cost:** No extra AWS charges, but you may need to license the JDBC driver.

---

**Summary:**  
The AWS Glue Salesforce Connector is easier to set up, managed, and feature-rich, but incurs extra cost. JDBC is more manual and flexible, but requires more maintenance and may lack advanced Salesforce-specific features.

### Query:
When using clientId,Clientsecret,refreshtoken,loginurl , redirect URI and also connector_url how is the access token obtained. Is it automatically taken care by AWS Glue

### Response:
Yes, when you provide the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `login_url`, `redirect_uri`, and `connector_url` in your AWS Glue Connection (using the AWS Glue Salesforce Connector), **AWS Glue automatically handles obtaining and refreshing the access token**.

You do **not** need to manually obtain or refresh the access token in your Glue jobs. The connector uses the provided OAuth credentials to authenticate with Salesforce as needed during job execution.

### Query:
When the access token obtained expires, is obtaining onother access token also taken care by AWS Glue 

### Response:
Yes, when the access token expires, **AWS Glue automatically uses the provided refresh token to obtain a new access token**. You do not need to handle token refresh yourself; the Glue Salesforce Connector manages this process during job execution.

### Query:
Do we need to ensure that  the sensitve fields when provisioning Glue Connection are not referenced directly in Terraform script but only  via Secrets Manager.

### Response:
Yes, it is a best practice to **avoid referencing sensitive fields (like client secret, refresh token, etc.) directly in your Terraform scripts**. Instead, you should store these secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager** (or AWS SSM Parameter Store) and reference them securely in your Terraform configuration.

This approach:
- Keeps sensitive data out of your codebase and version control.
- Helps meet security and compliance requirements.
- Makes secret rotation and management easier.

**Example:**  
You can use Terraform’s `aws_secretsmanager_secret` and `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` resources to manage secrets, and reference them in your Glue Connection using the appropriate syntax.

**Summary:**  
Always use AWS Secrets Manager (or similar) for sensitive fields in infrastructure provisioning.

### Query:
Can you provide examples of to use secretmanager in terraform to store a secret and reference them accordingly

### Response: 
Certainly! Here’s a step-by-step example of how to store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager using Terraform and reference them in your Glue Connection.

---

### 1. **Store a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager**

````hcl
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "salesforce_oauth" {
  name = "salesforce-oauth-secret"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "salesforce_oauth_version" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.salesforce_oauth.id
  secret_string = jsonencode({
    client_id     = "your-client-id"
    client_secret = "your-client-secret"
    refresh_token = "your-refresh-token"
    login_url     = "https://login.salesforce.com"
    redirect_uri  = "https://your-redirect-uri"
  })
}
````

---

### 2. **Reference the Secret in Your Glue Connection**

AWS Glue supports referencing secrets in Secrets Manager using the following syntax in connection properties:

```
{{resolve:secretsmanager:secret-name:SecretString:json-key}}
```

**Example:**

````hcl
resource "aws_glue_connection" "salesforce_marketplace" {
  name            = "salesforce-marketplace-connection"
  connection_type = "MARKETPLACE"

  connection_properties = {
    CONNECTOR_URL              = "arn:aws:aws-glue:us-east-1:123456789012:connector/salesforce"
    SFDC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID       = "{{resolve:secretsmanager:salesforce-oauth-secret:SecretString:client_id}}"
    SFDC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET   = "{{resolve:secretsmanager:salesforce-oauth-secret:SecretString:client_secret}}"
    SFDC_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN   = "{{resolve:secretsmanager:salesforce-oauth-secret:SecretString:refresh_token}}"
    SFDC_LOGIN_URL             = "{{resolve:secretsmanager:salesforce-oauth-secret:SecretString:login_url}}"
    SFDC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI    = "{{resolve:secretsmanager:salesforce-oauth-secret:SecretString:redirect_uri}}"
  }

  physical_connection_requirements {
    availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
    security_group_id_list = [aws_security_group.glue.id]
    subnet_id              = aws_subnet.glue.id
  }
}
````

---

**Summary:**  
- Store your secrets as a JSON object in Secrets Manager.
- Reference each secret field in your Glue Connection using the `{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}` syntax.
- This keeps sensitive data out of your Terraform code and state files.

Let me know if you need a full working example or help with IAM permissions!

### Query:
Yes. provide me a full working terraform  example along with the IAM permissions accordingly.

### Response:
Here’s a **full working Terraform example** to provision a Salesforce Glue Connection using secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, including the necessary IAM permissions for Glue to access the secrets.

---

**Notes:**
- Replace `"your-client-id"`, `"your-client-secret"`, `"your-refresh-token"`, and URLs with your actual Salesforce app values.
- Replace the `CONNECTOR_URL` value with the actual ARN of your subscribed Salesforce Glue Connector from AWS Marketplace.
- Replace the S3 script location in the Glue Job with your actual script path.
- This example creates a new VPC, subnet, and security group for demonstration. Use your existing networking resources as needed.

---

**IAM Permissions:**  
The IAM role for Glue is granted permission to read the specific secret from Secrets Manager.

---
### Required Oauth Scopes for SF to S3
For AWS Glue to access Salesforce data using the Salesforce Connector, you should configure the following **OAuth scopes** in your Salesforce Connected App:

- **Access and manage your data (api)**
- **Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
- *(Optional, but often useful)* **Full access (full)**

**Minimum required:**
- `api`
- `refresh_token` (or `offline_access`)

**How to configure:**
- In the Connected App, under **OAuth Scopes**, add:
  - `Access and manage your data (api)`
  - `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`

This ensures Glue can read/write data and refresh tokens as needed. Only add broader scopes (like `full`) if your use case requires it.
