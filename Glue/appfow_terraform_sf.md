### Query: 
How do we use AWS Appflow to connect to Salesforce , copy the data from there and save it to S3 bucket.

### Response: 
To use AWS AppFlow to connect to Salesforce, copy data, and save it to an S3 bucket, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - AWS account with permissions for AppFlow, S3, and IAM.
   - Salesforce account with API access.

2. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to the S3 console and create a bucket to store the data.

3. **Set Up Salesforce Connection in AppFlow**:
   - Go to the AWS AppFlow console.
   - Click **Connections** > **Create connection**.
   - Choose **Salesforce** as the source.
   - Authenticate using OAuth (you’ll be redirected to Salesforce to log in and authorize).

4. **Create a Flow**:
   - In AppFlow, click **Create flow**.
   - Enter a name and description.
   - **Source**: Select Salesforce and the connection you created.
   - Choose the Salesforce object (e.g., Account, Contact) you want to copy.
   - **Destination**: Select Amazon S3 and the bucket/folder.
   - Choose the file format (CSV, JSON, or Parquet).

5. **Configure Field Mapping**:
   - Map Salesforce fields to S3 output fields as needed.

6. **Set Flow Trigger**:
   - Choose how the flow runs: on demand, scheduled, or event-based.

7. **Review and Create**:
   - Review settings and click **Create flow**.
   - Run the flow manually or wait for the scheduled trigger.

**Result:**  
AppFlow will extract data from Salesforce and save it to your S3 bucket in the chosen format.

### Query:
Can we provision the AWS Appflow flow using Terraform when connecting to SF and reading the data and storing it to S3 bucket.

### Response: 
Yes, you can provision AWS AppFlow flows using Terraform, including connecting to Salesforce and storing data in an S3 bucket.

**How to do it:**

1. **Terraform Provider**:  
   Use the [AWS Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/appflow_flow).

2. **Resource Example**:  
   Here’s a basic example for provisioning an AppFlow flow from Salesforce to S3:

````hcl
resource "aws_appflow_connector_profile" "salesforce" {
  connector_type = "Salesforce"
  connector_profile_name = "my-salesforce-profile"

  connector_profile_config {
    connector_profile_credentials {
      salesforce {
        access_token = "<YOUR_SF_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
        refresh_token = "<YOUR_SF_REFRESH_TOKEN>"
        client_id     = "<YOUR_SF_CLIENT_ID>"
        client_secret = "<YOUR_SF_CLIENT_SECRET>"
      }
    }
    connector_profile_properties {
      salesforce {
        instance_url = "<YOUR_SF_INSTANCE_URL>"
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_appflow_flow" "sf_to_s3" {
  flow_name     = "sf-to-s3-flow"
  source_flow_config {
    connector_type = "Salesforce"
    connector_profile_name = aws_appflow_connector_profile.salesforce.connector_profile_name
    source_connector_properties {
      salesforce {
        object = "Account"
      }
    }
  }
  destination_flow_config {
    connector_type = "S3"
    destination_connector_properties {
      s3 {
        bucket_name = "<YOUR_S3_BUCKET>"
        bucket_prefix = "salesforce-data/"
        s3_output_format_config {
          file_type = "CSV"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  trigger_config {
    trigger_type = "OnDemand"
  }
  tasks {
    source_fields = ["Id", "Name"]
    task_type     = "Map"
    connector_operator {
      salesforce = "PROJECTION"
    }
    destination_field = "Id"
  }
}
````

**Notes:**
- You must securely manage Salesforce credentials (use Terraform variables or secrets manager).
- Adjust the Salesforce object, fields, and S3 bucket as needed.
- For production, consider using AWS Secrets Manager for credentials.

### Query:
Do we need to create a Salesforce Connected app in salesforce for this and then obtain client_id,client_Secret and refresh_token from there accordingly.

### Response:
Yes, you need to create a **Salesforce Connected App** to use AWS AppFlow (or Terraform) to connect to Salesforce.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a Connected App in Salesforce:**
   - Go to Salesforce Setup → Apps → App Manager → New Connected App.
   - Enable OAuth settings.
   - Set the callback URL (can be any valid URL for non-interactive use, e.g., `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/callback`).
   - Select required OAuth scopes (e.g., `Full access`, `Perform requests on your behalf at any time`).

2. **Obtain Credentials:**
   - After saving, note the **Consumer Key** (client_id) and **Consumer Secret** (client_secret).
   - Use these to perform the OAuth flow and obtain a **refresh_token**.

3. **Use in AppFlow/Terraform:**
   - Provide the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `refresh_token` in your AppFlow or Terraform configuration.

**Summary:**  
A Salesforce Connected App is required to securely authenticate and authorize AWS AppFlow to access your Salesforce data.

### Query:
Do we need to provide access_token in terraform and would that be automatically taken care by aws appflow usign the provied refresh_token

### Response:
You do **not** need to provide an `access_token` in your Terraform configuration for AWS AppFlow.  
You only need to provide the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `refresh_token`.

**How it works:**  
- AWS AppFlow uses the `refresh_token` (along with `client_id` and `client_secret`) to automatically obtain and refresh the `access_token` as needed.
- You do **not** need to manually manage or update the `access_token`.

**Summary:**  
Just provide the `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` in your Terraform or AppFlow setup. AWS AppFlow will handle access token management for you.

### Query:
Does this use Salesforce Connector from the marketplace or directly connects without a connector

### Response:
AWS AppFlow uses its **built-in Salesforce connector**—you do not need to install a separate Salesforce connector from the AWS Marketplace or Salesforce AppExchange. When you configure AppFlow (either via the AWS Console or Terraform), you select "Salesforce" as the connector type, and AppFlow manages the connection using the credentials and OAuth details you provide.

**Summary:**  
AppFlow connects directly to Salesforce using its native Salesforce connector. No additional marketplace connector is required.

### Query:
Which Salesforce API does appflow use, as Salesforce support both REST and also a bulk api.

### Response: AWS AppFlow uses both the **Salesforce REST API** and the **Salesforce Bulk API** depending on the flow configuration and data volume:

- For **smaller data transfers** and real-time flows, AppFlow typically uses the **Salesforce REST API**.
- For **large data transfers** (such as exporting large objects or many records), AppFlow automatically switches to the **Salesforce Bulk API** for better performance and efficiency.

**Summary:**  
AppFlow intelligently chooses between the REST API and Bulk API based on the operation and data size, so you don’t need to manually select the API.

### Query:
When storing to S3 , can we store the data in iceberg format

### Response:
As of now, **AWS AppFlow does not natively support writing data in Apache Iceberg format** when storing to S3. The supported output formats for S3 destinations in AppFlow are:

- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet

If you need your Salesforce data in Iceberg format, you can:

1. Use AppFlow to write data to S3 in Parquet or CSV format.
2. Use AWS Glue, Apache Spark, or another ETL tool to convert and register the data as an Iceberg table.

**Summary:**  
Direct Iceberg format is not supported by AppFlow. Use Parquet as an intermediate step and convert to Iceberg using other AWS analytics services.

### Query: 
Can we pull data from multiple objects in salesforce or we should use only one in a flow

### Response:
In AWS AppFlow, **each flow can pull data from only one Salesforce object at a time**. If you need to extract data from multiple objects, you must create a separate flow for each object.

**Workarounds:**
- Create multiple flows—one per Salesforce object.
- If you need to join or combine data from multiple objects, perform this step after extraction using AWS Glue, Athena, or another ETL tool.

**Summary:**  
One Salesforce object per AppFlow flow. Use multiple flows for multiple objects.
