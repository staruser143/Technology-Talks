#### Query:
How do I read data from Salesforce using AWS Glue Job and write to S3.

### Response: 
To read data from Salesforce using an AWS Glue Job and write it to S3, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Salesforce Connection in AWS Glue:**
   - Go to AWS Glue Console → Connections → Add connection.
   - Choose Salesforce as the connection type.
   - Enter your Salesforce credentials and connection details.

2. **Create an AWS Glue Job:**
   - Go to AWS Glue Console → Jobs → Add job.
   - Choose Spark or Python Shell as the job type.

3. **Sample PySpark Script:**

````python
# Use AWS Glue libraries
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from pyspark.context import SparkContext

# Initialize Glue context
sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session

# Read from Salesforce
datasource = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="salesforce",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "your-salesforce-connection",
        "sfObject": "Account",  # Replace with your Salesforce object
        "useConnectionProperties": "true"
    }
)

# Write to S3 in Parquet format
datasink = glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    frame=datasource,
    connection_type="s3",
    connection_options={"path": "s3://your-bucket/your-prefix/"},
    format="parquet"
)
````

4. **Configure the Job:**
   - Attach the Salesforce connection.
   - Set IAM permissions for Glue to access Salesforce and S3.

5. **Run the Job.**

**Note:**  
- Replace `"your-salesforce-connection"`, `"Account"`, and the S3 path with your actual values.
- You can change the output format (e.g., to CSV or JSON) by modifying the `format` parameter.


### Query: 
Does this example to use AWS Glue Salesforce connector

### Response:

Yes, the example uses the **AWS Glue Salesforce connector**.  
The key part is this section:

````python
datasource = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="salesforce",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "your-salesforce-connection",
        "sfObject": "Account",
        "useConnectionProperties": "true"
    }
)
````

- `connection_type="salesforce"` tells Glue to use the Salesforce connector.
- `connectionName` refers to the Salesforce connection you created in Glue.
- `sfObject` is the Salesforce object (table) you want to read.

This is the standard way to use the AWS Glue Salesforce connector to read data from Salesforce.

### Query:
Salesforce supports different APIs to provide data. Which one is being use by the Glue Connector

### Response:
The AWS Glue Salesforce connector uses the **Salesforce Bulk API** by default for reading data. If the Bulk API is not available or suitable (for example, for small datasets or unsupported operations), it may fall back to the **Salesforce REST API**.

- **Bulk API** is optimized for large data volumes and is the preferred method for Glue jobs.
- You can control some API behavior using connection options, but by default, Glue tries to use Bulk API for efficiency.

For more details, see the [AWS Glue Salesforce connector documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-connect.html#aws-glue-programming-etl-connect-salesforce).

### Query:
Can we use pyspark script instead of AWS Glue libraries in the AWS Glue Job.

### Response:
You **cannot** use only native PySpark libraries to connect directly to Salesforce in an AWS Glue Job.  
The native PySpark API does not include a Salesforce connector. AWS Glue provides its own connectors (like `create_dynamic_frame.from_options(connection_type="salesforce", ...)`) to enable this integration.

**Summary:**
- To read from Salesforce in Glue, you must use the AWS Glue libraries and connectors.
- Native PySpark alone does not support Salesforce as a data source.

If you want to use only PySpark, you would need to use a third-party JDBC/ODBC driver or a custom library, but this is not natively supported or recommended in AWS Glue.

### Query: 
How do I deploy the Glue Job using Terraform

###  Response: 
To deploy an AWS Glue Job using Terraform, follow these steps:

### 1. **Define the Glue Job Script Location**
Upload your Glue script (e.g., `glue_script.py`) to an S3 bucket.

### 2. **Create Required Resources in Terraform**
You’ll need:
- An S3 bucket for scripts and logs
- An IAM role for Glue
- The Glue connection (for Salesforce)
- The Glue job itself

### 3. **Sample Terraform Configuration**

````hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "glue_role" {
  name = "glue-service-role"
  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.glue_assume_role_policy.json
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "glue_assume_role_policy" {
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["glue.amazonaws.com"]
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "glue_s3_access" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.glue_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess"
}

resource "aws_glue_connection" "salesforce" {
  name = "my-salesforce-connection"
  connection_properties = {
    USERNAME = "your_salesforce_username"
    PASSWORD = "your_salesforce_password"
    # Add other required Salesforce properties
  }
  connection_type = "JDBC"
  physical_connection_requirements {
    availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
    security_group_id_list = []
    subnet_id              = ""
  }
}

resource "aws_glue_job" "example" {
  name     = "my-glue-job"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.glue_role.arn

  command {
    name            = "glueetl"
    script_location = "s3://your-bucket/scripts/glue_script.py"
    python_version  = "3"
  }

  default_arguments = {
    "--TempDir"              = "s3://your-bucket/temp/"
    "--job-language"         = "python"
    "--additional-python-modules" = "requests"
    "--connection_name"      = aws_glue_connection.salesforce.name
  }

  max_retries      = 1
  glue_version     = "4.0"
  number_of_workers = 2
  worker_type      = "G.1X"
}
````

### 4. **Deploy**
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

---

**Notes:**
- Replace placeholders (bucket names, Salesforce credentials, etc.) with your actual values.
- For Salesforce, you may need to use the [AWS Glue Marketplace Salesforce connector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-4b6k2w3w5v2gq) and configure accordingly.
- For managed connectors, use the `aws_glue_connection` resource with the correct `connection_type` and properties.


### Query:
Why do we need AWS glue Marketplace Salesforce connector for this script

### Response:
You need the **AWS Glue Marketplace Salesforce connector** because AWS Glue does **not natively support Salesforce as a built-in data source**. The built-in Glue connectors only support a limited set of sources (like JDBC, S3, Redshift, etc.), and Salesforce is not included by default.

The Marketplace Salesforce connector provides:
- Native integration with Salesforce APIs (Bulk, REST, etc.)
- Managed authentication and connection handling
- Support for reading and writing Salesforce objects directly from Glue jobs

**Without the Marketplace connector**, you cannot use `connection_type="salesforce"` in your Glue script or job definition.  
The connector must be subscribed to and attached to your Glue job for Salesforce integration to work as shown in your script.

### Query: 
How do I use the marketplace connector in Terraform script

### Response: 
To use the AWS Glue Marketplace Salesforce connector in your Terraform script, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Subscribe to the Connector**
First, subscribe to the [AWS Glue Salesforce Connector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-4b6k2w3w5v2gq) in AWS Marketplace.

---

### 2. **Create a Glue Connection Using the Connector**

Use the `aws_glue_connection` resource with `connection_type = "MARKETPLACE"` and specify the connector’s ARN.

````hcl
resource "aws_glue_connection" "salesforce_marketplace" {
  name            = "my-salesforce-marketplace-connection"
  connection_type = "MARKETPLACE"

  connection_properties = {
    CONNECTOR_URL = "https://login.salesforce.com"
    # Add other Salesforce connection properties as needed
    USERNAME      = "your_salesforce_username"
    PASSWORD      = "your_salesforce_password"
    SECURITYTOKEN = "your_salesforce_security_token"
  }

  physical_connection_requirements {
    availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
    security_group_id_list = []
    subnet_id              = ""
  }

  # The ARN of the Salesforce connector from Marketplace
  # Find this in the Marketplace product page or after subscribing
  # Example ARN (replace with actual):
  # arn:aws:catalog:us-east-1:123456789012:software/your-connector-id
  marketplace_connector {
    marketplace_connector_arn = "arn:aws:catalog:us-east-1:123456789012:software/your-connector-id"
  }
}
````

---

### 3. **Reference the Connection in Your Glue Job**

````hcl
resource "aws_glue_job" "example" {
  # ...existing code...
  default_arguments = {
    "--TempDir"         = "s3://your-bucket/temp/"
    "--job-language"    = "python"
    "--connection_name" = aws_glue_connection.salesforce_marketplace.name
  }
  # ...existing code...
}
````

---

**Notes:**
- Replace the `marketplace_connector_arn` with the actual ARN from your Marketplace subscription.
- Add all required Salesforce connection properties (USERNAME, PASSWORD, SECURITYTOKEN, etc.).
- The script in your Glue job should use `connection_type="salesforce"` in the Glue DynamicFrame.

---


### Query:
Yes. provide me a full working example

### Response: 
Here is a **full working Terraform example** to deploy an AWS Glue Job that uses the AWS Glue Marketplace Salesforce connector.

---

#### 1. **Prerequisites**
- Subscribe to the [AWS Glue Salesforce Connector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-4b6k2w3w5v2gq) in AWS Marketplace.
- Upload your Glue script (e.g., `glue_script.py`) to an S3 bucket.

---

#### 2. **Terraform Example**

````hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# IAM Role for Glue

### Query: 
Does Glue Connector work even with Salesforce SOAP APIs

### Response:
The AWS Glue Salesforce connector **does not use the Salesforce SOAP API** for data extraction.  
It primarily uses the **Salesforce Bulk API** for large data transfers and may fall back to the **REST API** for smaller datasets or unsupported operations.

**Summary:**  
- **Bulk API**: Main method for data extraction (default).
- **REST API**: Used as a fallback.
- **SOAP API**: **Not used** by the Glue Salesforce connector.

If you specifically need SOAP API support, you would need to implement custom logic outside of the Glue connector.

### Query:
What is a AWS managed connected app for salesforce and do we need one for conencting to salesfroce

### Response:
An **AWS managed connected app for Salesforce** is a pre-configured OAuth application created and managed by AWS within Salesforce. It allows AWS services (like AWS Glue, AppFlow, etc.) to securely connect to your Salesforce instance using OAuth authentication, without you having to manually create and configure a connected app in Salesforce.

**Do you need one for connecting to Salesforce?**

- **If you use the AWS Glue Salesforce connector (especially with OAuth authentication):**  
  Yes, you typically need to use the AWS managed connected app. This simplifies authentication and permissions, and is the recommended approach by AWS.

- **If you use username/password authentication:**  
  You do **not** need a connected app, but this method is less secure and not recommended for production.

**Summary:**  
- For secure, production-grade connections (OAuth), use the AWS managed connected app.
- For basic username/password connections, a connected app is not required, but this is less secure.  
- The AWS managed connected app is automatically set up when you follow AWS documentation for OAuth-based connections.

### Query:
When using the AWS managed conencted app , would there be any changes in the AWS glue code to conenct to salesforce

### Response:
When using the **AWS managed connected app** for Salesforce (OAuth authentication), you **do not need to change your AWS Glue code**. The code to connect to Salesforce using the Glue connector remains the same.

**What changes:**
- The **connection properties** in your AWS Glue Connection (in the AWS Console or Terraform) will use OAuth-related fields (like `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN`, etc.) instead of `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `SECURITYTOKEN`.
- The **Glue script** still uses:
  ```python
  glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
      connection_type="salesforce",
      connection_options={
          "connectionName": "your-glue-connection-name",
          "sfObject": "Account",
          "useConnectionProperties": "true"
      }
  )
  ```

**Summary:**  
- **No change in Glue code.**
- **Only the Glue connection configuration changes** to use OAuth credentials from the AWS managed connected app.

### Query:
What would the changes be in the Terraform script when using the AWS managed app to conenct to salesforce

### Response:
When using the **AWS managed connected app** (OAuth) to connect to Salesforce, you need to update the `aws_glue_connection` resource in your Terraform script to use **OAuth properties** instead of username/password.

---

### **Example: Terraform Glue Connection with AWS Managed Connected App**

````hcl
resource "aws_glue_connection" "salesforce_marketplace" {
  name            = "my-salesforce-marketplace-connection"
  connection_type = "MARKETPLACE"

  connection_properties = {
    CONNECTOR_URL = "https://login.salesforce.com"
    CLIENT_ID     = "your_salesforce_client_id"
    CLIENT_SECRET = "your_salesforce_client_secret"
    REFRESH_TOKEN = "your_salesforce_refresh_token"
    # Optionally, specify other OAuth properties if required
  }

  physical_connection_requirements {
    availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
    security_group_id_list = []
    subnet_id              = ""
  }

  marketplace_connector {
    marketplace_connector_arn = "arn:aws:catalog:us-east-1:533067255357:software/4b6k2w3w5v2gq"
  }
}
````

---

**Key Changes:**
- Replace `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `SECURITYTOKEN` with `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
- These OAuth values are obtained when you authorize AWS to access Salesforce via the AWS managed connected app.

**No changes are needed in your Glue job script.**

---



### Query: How do we generate OAuth credentials

### Response: To generate OAuth credentials for the AWS managed connected app with Salesforce, follow these steps:

### 1. **Initiate Connection Setup in AWS**
- Go to the **AWS Glue Console** (or AppFlow if using AppFlow).
- Start creating a new Salesforce connection.
- Choose **OAuth** as the authentication method.
- Click **Authorize connection**.

### 2. **Authorize in Salesforce**
- You will be redirected to the Salesforce login page.
- Log in with your Salesforce credentials.
- Grant AWS the requested permissions.

### 3. **AWS Retrieves OAuth Credentials**
- After authorization, AWS automatically retrieves and stores the required OAuth credentials (`CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN`) in the Glue connection.
- You do **not** need to manually copy these values; AWS manages them for you.

### 4. **Use the Connection in Glue**
- Reference the created connection in your Glue job or Terraform script by its name.

---

**Summary:**  
- The OAuth credentials are generated and managed by AWS when you authorize the AWS managed connected app via the AWS Console.
- You do not need to manually create a connected app or handle the credentials yourself.

If you need to automate this process or use custom apps, you would need to create a connected app in Salesforce and follow the standard OAuth flow to obtain the credentials. For most AWS Glue use cases, the above steps are sufficient.

### Query:
What happens when the token expires. Should we get a new token

### Response: 
When using OAuth with the AWS managed connected app for Salesforce, AWS Glue stores both the **refresh token** and the **access token**. 

- The **access token** is used for API calls and expires after a short period (usually minutes to hours).
- When the access token expires, AWS Glue automatically uses the **refresh token** to obtain a new access token from Salesforce.
- **You do not need to manually get a new token**—this process is handled automatically by AWS Glue as long as the refresh token remains valid and authorized.

**If the refresh token is revoked or expires** (for example, if permissions are changed or the user revokes access), you will need to re-authorize the connection in AWS to generate a new refresh token.
