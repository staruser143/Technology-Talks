Ensuring immutability is paramount in an event sourcing system. Once an event is written to the event store, it should never be modified or deleted. Here's how to enforce immutability when using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL:
1. Append-Only Design:
 * Never Update or Delete:
   * The fundamental principle is to design your application to only append new events to the Cosmos DB container. Never perform update or delete operations on existing events.
 * Enforce at the Application Level:
   * This is primarily an application-level responsibility. Your application logic should strictly adhere to the append-only pattern.
   * Code reviews and testing should emphasize immutability.
2. Partitioning and Event Ordering:
 * Partition Key Strategy:
   * As discussed earlier, use a suitable partition key (e.g., aggregate ID) to group related events within the same logical partition.
   * This ensures that events are stored and read in the correct order.
 * Append-Only Within Partition:
   * By only adding data to the end of a partition, you enforce the immutability of the existing documents within that partition.
3. Read-Only Access for Read Models:
 * Change Feed for Read Models:
   * Use the Cosmos DB change feed to propagate events to read models.
   * Read models should be designed to be updated by processing events from the change feed, not by directly accessing the event store.
 * Restrict Write Access:
   * Ensure that read models have read-only access to the event store container.
   * This prevents accidental modifications.
4. Event Versioning and Metadata:
 * Event Versioning:
   * Include a version number or timestamp in each event. This allows you to track the sequence of events and detect any out-of-order or missing events.
 * Metadata:
   * Store metadata with each event, such as:
     * Event creation timestamp.
     * User or system that generated the event.
     * Any relevant context information.
   * This metadata provides an audit trail and helps to ensure the integrity of the event store.
5. Avoid Direct Modifications:
 * No Direct SQL Updates:
   * Avoid using direct SQL update statements against the event store container.
   * All event writes should be performed through the application's event sourcing logic.
 * Restrict Permissions:
   * Restrict the permissions of any users or applications that have access to the Cosmos DB container. Only allow append operations.
6. Code Reviews and Testing:
 * Code Reviews:
   * Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure that the application adheres to the append-only pattern.
 * Testing:
   * Implement tests that verify that events are never modified or deleted.
   * Write tests that prove that events are always appended in the correct order.
In summary:
 * Immutability in Cosmos DB event sourcing is primarily enforced through application-level design and discipline.
 * By following the append-only pattern, using appropriate partitioning, and restricting access, you can ensure the integrity and immutability of your event store.


You're right to ask about built-in mechanisms. While Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL offers powerful features, it doesn't have a direct, declarative trigger or constraint specifically designed to prevent updates or deletes of existing documents in the way a traditional relational database might.
Here's a breakdown of why and what Cosmos DB provides:
Why No Direct "Prevent Update/Delete" Triggers:
 * Focus on Scalability and Performance:
   * Cosmos DB is architected for high throughput and low latency at massive scale. Adding complex, pre-write or pre-delete triggers that would need to inspect and potentially block operations could significantly impact performance.
 * Partitioning and Distributed Nature:
   * Cosmos DB's distributed nature and partitioning model make it challenging to implement global constraints or triggers that would apply across all partitions.
 * Application-Level Control:
   * Cosmos DB leans towards providing fundamental building blocks (like change feed, transactional batching, and conditional updates) and encourages application developers to implement business logic and constraints at the application level.
What Cosmos DB Does Provide:
 * Change Feed:
   * While it doesn't prevent updates, the change feed allows you to monitor changes in real-time. You could theoretically build an external process that monitors the change feed and alerts or takes action if an unexpected update or delete occurs. However, this is a reactive approach, not a preventative one.
 * Conditional Updates (ETags):
   * ETags enable optimistic concurrency control. You can use them to ensure that an update only occurs if the document hasn't been modified since you last read it. This helps prevent concurrent updates but doesn't strictly prevent them.
 * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   * You can use RBAC to restrict permissions on your Cosmos DB container. You can grant read and append-only permissions to certain users or applications, effectively preventing them from updating or deleting existing documents. This is the closest CosmosDB has to a prevention mechanism.
 * Stored Procedures and Triggers (Limited Use):
   * Cosmos DB does support stored procedures and triggers. However, these are executed within the scope of a single partition. So they could not be used to globally enforce immutability. Also, they can add latency to operations. Thus, they are not a good fit for high throughput event sourcing.
Key Points:
 * The responsibility for enforcing immutability in an event sourcing system using Cosmos DB primarily falls on the application layer.
 * Cosmos DB provides tools and features that can help you implement this logic, but it doesn't have a built-in "prevent update/delete" mechanism.
 * RBAC is the closest built in feature to prevent updates.
Therefore, you must design your application to be append-only and implement appropriate checks and controls to ensure that events are never modified or deleted.
