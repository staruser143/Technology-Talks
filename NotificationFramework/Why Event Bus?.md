An **event bus** (like Kafka, Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ) is not strictly mandatory, but it becomes very valuable when your notification system needs to handle **scale, decoupling, and reliability**. Here‚Äôs why:

---

### ‚úÖ Why Use an Event Bus?

1. **Decoupling Producers and Notification Service**
   - Your business systems (Order Service, Payment Service, Security Service) just emit events like `OrderPlaced` or `OtpRequested`.
   - They don‚Äôt need to know about channels, templates, or providers.
   - The Notification Orchestrator consumes these events asynchronously and handles the complexity.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Notifications (especially email or SMS) can be slow due to provider latency.
   - Event bus allows you to **queue and process in background**, so your main transaction (e.g., placing an order) is not blocked.

3. **Scalability**
   - If you have spikes (e.g., flash sale ‚Üí 1M emails), the event bus buffers load.
   - Workers can scale horizontally to consume from the queue at their own pace.

4. **Reliability & Retry**
   - Event bus provides **durable storage** and **at-least-once delivery**.
   - If a worker crashes, the message stays in the queue.
   - You can implement **DLQs** for failed notifications.

5. **Fan-out to Multiple Consumers**
   - Same event can trigger multiple actions:
     - Notification Service sends email/SMS.
     - Analytics Service logs metrics.
     - Fraud Service monitors patterns.
   - No need for each producer to call multiple services.

6. **Observability & Replay**
   - You can **replay events** for debugging or backfilling notifications.
   - Useful for compliance audits or when adding new channels later.

### ‚ùå When You Might Skip It
- If your system is **small-scale**, synchronous calls from app ‚Üí Notification API might be enough.
- If you don‚Äôt need **decoupling** or **high throughput** (e.g., <100 notifications/day).

---

### ‚úÖ Alternative Without Event Bus
- Direct API call from app ‚Üí Notification Service.
- Notification Service handles orchestration and sends immediately.
- But then:
  - Producers are tightly coupled to Notification Service.
  - Harder to scale and retry.
  - No easy fan-out.

üëâ **Rule of Thumb:**  
If you expect **high volume**, **multiple producers**, or **future extensibility**, an event bus is worth it.  
If it‚Äôs a **simple, low-volume system**, you can start without it and add later.

Do you want me to **draw a comparison diagram** showing **with vs without event bus** for this architecture? Or should I give you a **minimal design without event bus** for your case?
