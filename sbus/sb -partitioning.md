The `enable_partitioning` property in Azure Service Bus is used to **improve scalability and availability** of topics and queues by **distributing messages across multiple message brokers (partitions)**.

### ‚úÖ What Does `enable_partitioning = true` Do?

When you set `enable_partitioning` to `true`:

- **Messages are distributed across multiple partitions**.
- Each partition is stored and processed independently.
- This allows **higher throughput** and **better load balancing**.
- It also provides **resilience**‚Äîif one partition fails, others can continue processing.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

| Feature                         | Behavior When Partitioning is Enabled |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Message Ordering**             | Not guaranteed across partitions unless you use `SessionId` |
| **Duplicate Detection**          | Still works, but only within a partition |
| **Sessions**                     | Supported, but all messages in a session go to the same partition |
| **Throughput**                   | Improved due to parallelism |
| **Once Enabled**                 | Cannot be disabled later |

### üß† When Should You Enable It?

‚úÖ **Enable** if:
- You expect **high message volume**.
- You want **better performance and fault tolerance**.

‚ùå **Avoid** if:
- You need **strict global ordering** without using sessions.
- Your workload is small and simple.
