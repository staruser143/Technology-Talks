Yes, you're absolutely correct â€” the **daily reminder workflow** should be **separate from the main workflow** that initiates the eSignature request. Here's how the separation works and why it's beneficial:

---

### ðŸ§© **Workflow Separation Overview**

#### âœ… **Main Workflow: Signature Request**
- **Trigger**: Agent submits an enrollment application.
- **Actions**:
  - Generate the enrollment document.
  - Send it to the eSignature platform (e.g., DocuSign).
  - Store the request ID and submission date.
  - Mark the application as `Awaiting Signature`.

#### âœ… **Reminder Workflow: Periodic Follow-Up**
- **Trigger**: Daily recurrence.
- **Actions**:
  - Query applications with `Awaiting Signature`.
  - Calculate days since submission.
  - Send reminders on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 11.
  - Update reminder history.
  - Optionally mark as `Pending â€“ Signature Not Received` after Day 15.

| **Scalability** | Reminder logic can scale separately from submission logic |
| **Efficiency** | Avoids long-running or overly complex workflows |
