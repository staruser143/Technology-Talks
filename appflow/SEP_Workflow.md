To include a **Special Enrollment Period (SEP) workflow** into your overall architecture, you can design it as a **parallel or conditional workflow** that integrates with the main enrollment and eSignature flows. Here's how you can structure it:

---

### ðŸ§© **SEP Workflow Integration Strategy**

#### âœ… **1. SEP Workflow Purpose**
- Validates if the enrollment request qualifies for a **life event** (e.g., marriage, birth, job loss).
- If valid, allows enrollment outside the standard open enrollment period.
- May require **supporting documentation** and **additional review steps**.

---

### ðŸ”„ **How to Integrate SEP Workflow**

#### **A. Trigger Point**
- SEP validation is triggered **after the agent submits the enrollment application** but **before** the eSignature request is sent.

#### **B. Workflow Steps**
1. **Check SEP Eligibility**:
   - Evaluate submitted life event type and date.
   - Validate against SEP rules (e.g., within 60 days of event).

2. **Request Documentation** (if needed):
   - Send email or portal notification to upload proof (e.g., marriage certificate).

3. **Review & Approve SEP**:
   - Manual or automated review.
   - If approved â†’ proceed to eSignature workflow.
   - If denied â†’ notify agent and mark application as ineligible.

4. **Log SEP Decision**:
   - Store SEP status and decision date in Azure SQL.

### ðŸ§  **Workflow Integration Points**

| **Workflow**         | **Integration Point** |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Main Enrollment**  | SEP check before eSignature |
| **eSignature**       | Triggered only if SEP is approved |
| **Reminder Workflow**| Runs only for SEP-approved applications |
| **Document Storage** | Stores SEP documents in Azure Blob Storage |
| **Audit Logging**    | Tracks SEP validation and decisions |

---

### ðŸ“Š **Architecture Suggestion**

You now have **three coordinated workflows**:

1. **Enrollment Submission & SEP Validation**
2. **eSignature Request & Completion**
3. **Reminder Workflow for Signature Follow-up**
