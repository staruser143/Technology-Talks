Here’s a **detailed decision matrix** comparing modernization strategies with **cost, timeline, and risk scoring** (on a relative scale: Low, Medium, High):

### **Legacy Modernization Decision Matrix**

| **Strategy** | **Cost** | **Timeline** | **Risk** | **Notes** |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Rehosting (Lift & Shift)** | **Low–Medium** (infra + migration tools) | **Short** (3–6 months) | **Medium** (tech debt persists) | Quick cloud benefits, but no functional improvements. |
| **Replatforming** | **Medium** (infra + minor code changes) | **Medium** (6–12 months) | **Medium** (integration complexity) | Adds some cloud-native features, better performance. |
| **Refactoring / Re-architecting** | **High** (engineering + testing) | **Long** (12–24 months) | **High** (complex migration, skill gaps) | Enables microservices, APIs, and future innovation. |
| **Replace with SaaS / COTS** | **Medium–High** (licenses + migration) | **Medium** (9–18 months) | **Medium–High** (vendor lock-in, data migration) | Best for standard processes; reduces IT overhead. |
| **Hybrid / Phased Modernization** | **Variable** (depends on mix) | **Variable** (phased over 12–36 months) | **Medium** (integration governance) | Balanced approach; minimizes disruption. |

### **Scoring Framework**
- **Cost**: Includes infra, licenses, engineering, and change management.
- **Timeline**: Estimated for a single core system (e.g., claims or policy admin).
- **Risk**: Based on complexity, data migration, and business disruption.
