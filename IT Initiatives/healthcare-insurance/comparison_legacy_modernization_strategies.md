### **Legacy Modernization Strategies**

| **Strategy**       | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Best Use Cases** |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Rehosting (Lift & Shift)** | Move existing applications to cloud infrastructure with minimal code changes. | - Quick migration<br>- Lower upfront cost<br>- Immediate infra scalability | - Limited modernization<br>- Doesn’t fix code-level issues<br>- May retain inefficiencies | When speed is critical and systems are stable but need cloud benefits. |
| **Replatforming** | Move to cloud and make minor optimizations (e.g., database change, containerization). | - Improves performance<br>- Enables some cloud-native features<br>- Moderate cost | - Still tied to legacy architecture<br>- Partial modernization only | When you need better scalability and cost optimization without full rewrite. |
| **Refactoring / Re-architecting** | Rewrite or restructure applications to leverage microservices and cloud-native design. | - High scalability<br>- Enables innovation (AI, APIs)<br>- Future-proof | - High cost and complexity<br>- Longer timelines<br>- Requires skilled teams | When long-term agility and digital transformation are strategic priorities. |
| **Replace with SaaS / COTS** | Replace legacy core systems with modern SaaS or commercial off-the-shelf solutions. | - Rapid feature adoption<br>- Lower maintenance<br>- Vendor-managed compliance | - Vendor lock-in<br>- Customization limits<br>- Data migration complexity | When core systems are outdated and standard processes fit SaaS capabilities. |
| **Hybrid / Phased Modernization** | Combine strategies: migrate some apps, refactor others, integrate via APIs. | - Balanced risk<br>- Incremental value<br>- Flexible approach | - Requires strong integration<br>- Governance complexity | When you need to modernize gradually without disrupting operations. |
