Query: How do you use Azure Logic Apps to create a a workflow

Azure (Preview): I can help with that. First, you need to install the GitHub Copilot for Azure extension.

Install GitHub Copilot for Azure

After that, please repeat your question.

Query: Does that need connection to Azure

GitHub Copilot: Yes, creating and running workflows with Azure Logic Apps requires a connection to an Azure subscription. Logic Apps is a cloud service, so you need to:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal** (https://portal.azure.com).
2. **Create a Logic App resource** in your Azure subscription.
3. **Design your workflow** using the Logic Apps Designer, which connects to Azure services and other connectors.

You can design workflows locally using Visual Studio Code with the Logic Apps extension, but deploying and running them still requires an Azure connection.

Query: What is a Logic App Resoruce

GitHub Copilot: An **Azure Logic App resource** is a cloud-based service in Microsoft Azure that lets you automate workflows and business processes. It acts as a container for your workflow, where you define triggers (what starts the workflow) and actions (what the workflow does).

When you create a Logic App resource in Azure, you get:

- A dedicated environment to design, run, and manage your workflow.
- Integration with hundreds of connectors (like Office 365, SQL, Service Bus, etc.).
- Monitoring and management tools for your workflow runs.

You create a Logic App resource through the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or ARM templates. Once created, you use the Logic Apps Designer to build your workflow visually.

Query: Can I use Terraform to create Logic App resource

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can use **Terraform** to create an Azure Logic App resource.

Terraform provides the `azurerm_logic_app_workflow` resource to define and deploy Logic Apps. You can also use Terraform to manage related resources like resource groups, connections, and triggers.

**Example:**

````hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_logic_app_workflow" "example" {
  name                = "example-logicapp"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  definition = <<DEFINITION
{
  "definition": {
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Logic/schemas/2016-06-01/workflowdefinition.json#",
    "actions": {},
    "triggers": {},
    "outputs": {}
  },
  "parameters": {}
}
DEFINITION

  parameters = "{}"
}
````

**Steps:**
1. Write your Terraform configuration.
2. Run `terraform init`.
3. Run `terraform apply`.

You can customize the `definition` block to specify your workflow’s triggers and actions.

Query: Do we still need to access Azure Portal to work with the Azure App REsource after running the script

GitHub Copilot: You do **not** need to use the Azure Portal to create or deploy the Logic App resource if you use Terraform—the resource will be created and configured as defined in your script.

However, you **might** still use the Azure Portal for:
- **Visual workflow editing** (the Logic Apps Designer is web-based).
- **Monitoring and troubleshooting** workflow runs.
- **Managing connections** or viewing logs.

**Summary:**  
- **Terraform** handles deployment and updates.
- **Azure Portal** is optional for management, monitoring, and visual editing.  
You can do most tasks with Terraform and the Azure CLI, but the Portal provides a graphical interface for some features.

Query: Can you provide a sample workflow  definition which can be intergrated with terraform script

Query: Provie a workflow definition for a business process with multiple steps to understand its workings.

GitHub Copilot: 

Query: For an order processing system , how do the workflow be defined

GitHub Copilot: Here’s a sample **Logic App workflow definition** for an order processing system with multiple steps. This example covers:

1. **Trigger:** When a new order is received (HTTP request).
2. **Step 1:** Validate the order.
3. **Step 2:** Check inventory.
4. **Step 3:** Process payment.
5. **Step 4:** Send confirmation email.

You can use this JSON in your Terraform `azurerm_logic_app_workflow` resource’s `definition` property.

````json

            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "items": { "type": "array" },

        }
      }
    }
  },
  "outputs": {}
}
````

**How it works:**
- The workflow is triggered by an HTTP request (e.g., from your app or API).
- It validates the order data.
- Checks inventory by calling an external API.
- Processes payment by calling another API.
- Sends a confirmation email.

You can expand each step with more actions, conditions, or error handling as needed.  
**Replace the URIs** with your actual service endpoints.

Query: How is the trigger defined for the workflow

GitHub Copilot: In an Azure Logic App workflow, the **trigger** defines what starts the workflow. In the sample order processing workflow above, the trigger is defined as follows:

````json
// Trigger definition for Logic App workflow
"triggers": {
  "When_a_HTTP_request_is_received": {
    "type": "Request",
    "kind": "Http",
    "inputs": {
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "orderId": { "type": "string" },
          "items": { "type": "array" },
          "amount": { "type": "number" },
          "customerEmail": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": [ "orderId", "items", "amount", "customerEmail" ]
      }
    }
  }
}
````

**Explanation:**
- `"type": "Request"` and `"kind": "Http"` specify that the workflow is triggered by an HTTP request.
- The `"schema"` defines the expected JSON payload structure for the incoming request.

**Result:**  
When an HTTP POST request with the specified schema is sent to the Logic App’s endpoint, the workflow is triggered and begins processing.

Query: Does that mean Logic App has an endpoint to which we can post requests?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, when you use the **HTTP Request** trigger in a Logic App, Azure automatically creates a unique HTTP endpoint URL for your Logic App. You can send HTTP POST requests to this endpoint to start the workflow.

You can find this endpoint URL in the Azure Portal after saving your Logic App, or retrieve it programmatically. This allows your applications or services to trigger the Logic App by posting data to that URL.

Query: When using Terraform to provision Logic App Resource, would we have to define outputs to get the endpoint URL once provisioned.

GitHub Copilot: Yes, if you want to retrieve the Logic App’s HTTP endpoint URL after provisioning with Terraform, you should define an **output** in your Terraform configuration.

For a Logic App with an HTTP trigger, you can use the `workflow_trigger_callback_url` data source to get the endpoint URL:

````hcl
data "azurerm_logic_app_trigger_callback_url" "example" {
  logic_app_id = azurerm_logic_app_workflow.example.id
  trigger_name = "When_a_HTTP_request_is_received"
}

output "logic_app_http_endpoint" {
  value = data.azurerm_logic_app_trigger_callback_url.example.value
}
````

**How it works:**
- The data source fetches the callback URL for the specified trigger.
- The output block makes the endpoint URL available after `terraform apply`.

You can then see the endpoint in your Terraform output.

Query: What other ways can we trigger the Logic App workflow

GitHub Copilot: Azure Logic Apps supports many types of triggers beyond HTTP requests. Some common ways to trigger a Logic App workflow include:

- **Recurrence (Timer):** Run on a schedule (e.g., every hour, daily).
- **Service Bus:** When a message arrives in a Service Bus queue or topic.
- **Event Grid/Event Hub:** When an event is published to Event Grid or Event Hub.
- **Blob Storage:** When a new blob is added or modified in Azure Storage.
- **Email:** When an email is received (e.g., via Outlook or Office 365).
- **SQL Database:** When a row is inserted or updated.
- **SharePoint:** When an item is created or modified in a SharePoint list.
- **Manual:** Triggered manually from the Azure Portal or via API.
- **Custom connectors:** Using third-party or custom triggers.

Each trigger type is defined in the Logic App’s workflow definition and can be selected in the Logic Apps Designer or specified in JSON.

Query: Where is the state maintained in workflow when it progresses in the workflow

GitHub Copilot: In Azure Logic Apps, the **state of the workflow** is managed and persisted automatically by the Logic Apps service. As the workflow progresses through its steps (actions), Azure stores the state, inputs, outputs, and status of each action.

**Key points:**
- **State is not stored in your app or infrastructure.**
- Azure Logic Apps maintains the state in its own managed storage.
- This allows workflows to be long-running, resilient to failures, and resumable after delays or outages.
- You can view the state and history of each run in the Azure Portal under the Logic App’s “Runs history.”

**Summary:**  
You do not need to manage workflow state yourself—Azure Logic Apps handles it for you.

Query: If there are multiple requests recived for the workflow, would there be multiple instances of the workflow created as separate threads

GitHub Copilot: Yes, when multiple requests are received by a Logic App workflow (for example, via its HTTP trigger), **Azure Logic Apps creates a separate workflow instance for each request**. Each instance runs independently and maintains its own state, inputs, and outputs.

These instances are managed by the Logic Apps service and are not tied to threads in your code. They can run in parallel, and you can view each run separately in the Azure Portal under the Logic App’s “Runs history.”

**Summary:**  
- Each request = a new, independent workflow instance.
- All instances are isolated and managed by Azure Logic Apps.

Query: Does Azure logic apps provides an API to get insight on the execution of workflows like history, status etc

GitHub Copilot: Yes, Azure Logic Apps provides a **REST API** and **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API** to get insights into workflow executions, including run history, status, inputs, outputs, and errors.

**Common API endpoints:**
- **List workflow runs:**  
  `GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/{workflowName}/runs?api-version=2019-05-01`
- **Get a specific run:**  
  `GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/{workflowName}/runs/{runName}?api-version=2019-05-01`
- **List actions in a run:**  
  `GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/{workflowName}/runs/{runName}/actions?api-version=2019-05-01`

You can use these APIs to programmatically monitor, audit, and analyze workflow executions.  
**Documentation:**  
[Azure Logic Apps REST API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/logic/)

Query: What is a run, is it an instance of the workflow

GitHub Copilot: Yes, in Azure Logic Apps, a **run** is an instance of the workflow.  

Each time the workflow is triggered (for example, by an HTTP request or a scheduled event), a new run is created. This run represents a single execution of the workflow, with its own state, inputs, outputs, and execution history.  

You can view and manage each run separately in the Azure Portal or via the Logic Apps API.

Query: Can we define multiple triggers for a workflow

GitHub Copilot: No, in Azure Logic Apps (Standard and Consumption), **a workflow can have only one trigger**. Each workflow starts with a single trigger, which defines how the workflow is initiated.

If you need to start the same workflow from multiple sources, you can:
- Create separate workflows, each with its own trigger, and call a common child workflow.
- Use a trigger that supports multiple event types (like Event Grid with multiple event subscriptions).
- Use a generic trigger (like HTTP) and route requests internally based on the payload.

**Summary:**  
A single workflow = one trigger. For multiple triggers, use multiple workflows or orchestrate with child workflows.

Query: What are the different types , Standard and Consumption and when should we use them for which scenario

GitHub Copilot: Azure Logic Apps offers two main hosting models: **Consumption** and **Standard**.
