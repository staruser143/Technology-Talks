Combining **Event Sourcing** with **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** as the Event Store and an **orchestrator based on a messaging platform like Kafka or Azure Event Hubs** is a powerful architecture for building scalable, resilient, and consistent systems. Hereâ€™s how these components work together:

---

### **1. Overview of the Architecture**
- **Event Sourcing**: Events are appended to the Event Store (Cosmos DB) and represent the state changes of aggregates.
- **Orchestrator**: A central service (e.g., Saga Manager) coordinates the steps of a Saga by producing and consuming messages (commands and events) via Kafka or Azure Event Hubs.
- **Messaging Platform**: Kafka or Azure Event Hubs acts as the communication backbone between the orchestrator and the aggregates.

---

### **2. How the Components Work Together**

#### **a. Event Sourcing with Cosmos DB**
- **Appending Events**:
  - When an aggregate changes state, an event is appended to the Event Store (Cosmos DB).
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "eventID": "event-1",
      "quoteID": "quote-123",
      "eventType": "QuoteApproved",
      "sequenceNumber": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z",
      "data": {
        "premium": 1200,
        "customerId": "cust-456"
      }
    }
    ```
  - The `quoteID` is used as the **partition key** to ensure events for the same aggregate are stored together.

- **Reading Events**:
  - The orchestrator or aggregates can read events from the Event Store to rebuild the state of an aggregate.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Events WHERE quoteID = 'quote-123' ORDER BY sequenceNumber ASC
    ```

#### **b. Orchestrator with Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**
- **Producing Commands**:
  - The orchestrator produces commands to trigger actions in other aggregates.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "commandID": "command-1",
      "quoteID": "quote-123",
      "commandType": "CreatePolicy",
      "data": {
        "premium": 1200,
        "customerId": "cust-456"
      }
    }
    ```

- **Consuming Events**:
  - The orchestrator listens to events produced by aggregates to determine the next step.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "eventID": "event-2",
      "policyID": "policy-789",
      "eventType": "PolicyCreated",
      "data": {
        "quoteID": "quote-123",
        "customerId": "cust-456"
      }
    }
    ```

- **Compensating Commands**:
  - If a step fails, the orchestrator produces compensating commands to undo changes.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "commandID": "command-2",
      "quoteID": "quote-123",
      "commandType": "RejectQuote",
      "data": {
        "reason": "Policy creation failed"
      }
    }
    ```

---

### **3. Example Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Append Event to Event Store**
- When a quote is approved, append a `QuoteApproved` event to Cosmos DB.
  ```json
  {
    "eventID": "event-1",
    "quoteID": "quote-123",
    "eventType": "QuoteApproved",
    "sequenceNumber": 1,
    "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z",
    "data": {
      "premium": 1200,
      "customerId": "cust-456"
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Step 2: Orchestrator Produces Command**
- The orchestrator reads the `QuoteApproved` event from Cosmos DB and produces a `CreatePolicy` command to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
  ```json
  {
    "commandID": "command-1",
    "quoteID": "quote-123",
    "commandType": "CreatePolicy",
    "data": {
      "premium": 1200,
      "customerId": "cust-456"
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Step 3: Policy Aggregate Consumes Command**
- The `Policy` aggregate listens to the `CreatePolicy` command, creates a policy, and appends a `PolicyCreated` event to Cosmos DB.
  ```json
  {
    "eventID": "event-2",
    "policyID": "policy-789",
    "eventType": "PolicyCreated",
    "sequenceNumber": 2,
    "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:01:00Z",
    "data": {
      "quoteID": "quote-123",
      "customerId": "cust-456"
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Step 4: Orchestrator Produces Next Command**
- The orchestrator reads the `PolicyCreated` event from Cosmos DB and produces an `UpdateCustomerPolicyCount` command to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
  ```json
  {
    "commandID": "command-2",
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "commandType": "UpdateCustomerPolicyCount",
    "data": {
      "policyCount": 5
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Step 5: Handle Failures**
- If the `Policy` aggregate fails to create a policy, it appends a `PolicyCreationFailed` event to Cosmos DB.
  ```json
  {
    "eventID": "event-3",
    "quoteID": "quote-123",
    "eventType": "PolicyCreationFailed",
    "sequenceNumber": 3,
    "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:02:00Z",
    "data": {
      "reason": "Invalid premium amount"
    }
  }
  ```
- The orchestrator reads the `PolicyCreationFailed` event and produces a `RejectQuote` command to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
  ```json
  {
    "commandID": "command-3",
    "quoteID": "quote-123",
    "commandType": "RejectQuote",
    "data": {
      "reason": "Policy creation failed"
    }
  }
  ```

### **4. Key Considerations**

#### **a. Event Ordering**
- Use **partition keys** (e.g., `quoteID`) in Cosmos DB to ensure events for the same aggregate are stored and read in order.
- Use **sequence numbers** to enforce the correct order of events.

#### **b. Idempotency**
- Ensure that commands and events are idempotent to handle retries and duplicates.
- Example:
  - Before creating a policy, check if it already exists.

#### **c. Consistency**
- Use the **Change Feed** in Cosmos DB to trigger the orchestrator when new events are appended.
- Example:
  - The orchestrator listens to the Change Feed for `QuoteApproved` events and produces the corresponding commands.

#### **d. Scalability**
- Use **partition keys** in Kafka/Azure Event Hubs to ensure commands and events for the same Saga instance are processed sequentially.
- Example:
  - Use the `quoteID` as the partition key for the `saga-commands` and `saga-events` topics.

---

### **5. Tools and Libraries**
- **Cosmos DB Change Feed**: Use the Change Feed to trigger the orchestrator when new events are appended.
- **Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**: Use these platforms for producing and consuming commands and events.
- **Orchestration Frameworks**: Use frameworks like **Camunda**, **Zeebe**, or **Temporal** to manage Saga workflows.

---

### **6. Summary**
- **Event Sourcing** with Cosmos DB provides a durable and scalable Event Store.
- The **orchestrator** coordinates the steps of the Saga by producing and consuming commands and events via Kafka or Azure Event Hubs.
- Use **partition keys** and **sequence numbers** to ensure event ordering and consistency.
- Ensure **idempotency** and **durability** to handle failures and retries.

By combining Event Sourcing with Cosmos DB and an orchestrator based on Kafka or Azure Event Hubs, you can build a scalable, resilient, and consistent system for the Quoting scenario.
