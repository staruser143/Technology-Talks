Great question — let’s clarify what this command does and what `myapp` refers to.

---

## ❓ What does this command do?

```bash
linkerd stat deploy -n myapp
```

This command **shows real-time, aggregated metrics for all Deployments in the namespace `myapp`**, as observed by Linkerd’s service mesh.

It does **not** show stats for a Deployment *named* `myapp` — unless you have a Deployment literally named `myapp`.

> ✅ The `-n myapp` flag means “in the namespace called `myapp`” — not “for the Deployment named myapp”.

## 📊 Sample Output

```bash
NAME         MESHED   SUCCESS      RPS   LATENCY_P50   LATENCY_P99   TCP_CONN
web          3/3      100.00%   8.2rps           5ms          22ms         12
users        2/2       99.20%   6.1rps          15ms          98ms          8
orders       1/1       97.50%   3.4rps          45ms         210ms          4
```

### Column Meanings:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `NAME` | Name of the **Deployment** |
| `MESHED` | How many **Pods are meshed** (have Linkerd sidecar) vs total replicas (e.g., `3/3` = all 3 pods are meshed) |
| `SUCCESS` | Percentage of **successful requests** (non-5xx) over the last 1m |
| `RPS` | Requests per second |
| `LATENCY_P50` | Median (50th percentile) request latency |
| `LATENCY_P99` | 99th percentile latency — shows worst-case experience |
| `TCP_CONN` | Number of active TCP connections to/from this Deployment’s pods |

## ✅ How to Check Stats for a Specific Deployment

If you want stats for a **Deployment named `myapp`** (in any namespace), use:

```bash
linkerd stat deploy myapp -n <namespace>
```

Example:
```bash
linkerd stat deploy frontend -n production
```

→ Shows metrics only for the `frontend` Deployment in the `production` namespace.

---

## 🔍 Under the Hood

- Linkerd’s **control plane** (specifically, the `linkerd-prometheus` and `linkerd-metrics-api` components) scrapes metrics from each sidecar proxy.
- The `linkerd stat` CLI queries this aggregated data and displays it in human-readable format.
- Metrics are collected **per pod**, then **aggregated per resource** (Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.).

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Watch in Real-Time
Add `-w` to watch live updates:

```bash
linkerd stat deploy -n myapp -w
```

→ Great for monitoring during deployments or incident response.

---

### 2. Check Other Resources

You can also check stats for:

```bash
linkerd stat rs      # ReplicaSets
linkerd stat sts     # StatefulSets
linkerd stat pod     # Individual Pods
linkerd stat svc     # Services
```

Example:
```bash
linkerd stat pod -n myapp
```

→ Shows per-pod metrics — useful for spotting outliers.

---

### 3. Add Time Window

By default, stats are over 1-minute window. Change with `--time-window`:

```bash
linkerd stat deploy -n myapp --time-window 10m
```

---

### 4. Output as JSON or CSV

For scripting or automation:

```bash
linkerd stat deploy -n myapp -o json
linkerd stat deploy -n myapp -o wide  # more columns
```

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake: Thinking `-n myapp` means Deployment name

```bash
# ❌ This does NOT show stats for a Deployment called "myapp"
linkerd stat deploy -n myapp

# ✅ This DOES
linkerd stat deploy myapp -n <namespace>
```

→ Always remember: `-n` = namespace, positional arg = resource name.

---

### ❌ Mistake: Forgetting to Mesh the Workload

If `MESHED` shows `0/3`, the pods don’t have the Linkerd sidecar → no metrics.

✅ Fix: Inject sidecar:

```bash
kubectl -n myapp rollout restart deploy
# (assuming namespace is labeled for auto-injection)
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `linkerd stat deploy -n myapp` | Shows metrics for **all Deployments** in **namespace `myapp`** |
| `linkerd stat deploy myapp -n prod` | Shows metrics for **Deployment named `myapp`** in **namespace `prod`** |
| `linkerd stat deploy -n myapp -w` | Watches metrics live |
| `linkerd stat pod -n myapp` | Shows per-pod metrics |

> 💡 Think of `linkerd stat` as your **real-time service health dashboard in the terminal** — no UI needed.

It’s one of the most powerful and frequently used Linkerd commands for operators and SREs.

---

✅ **Bottom Line**:  
`linkerd stat deploy -n myapp` = “Show me how all my Deployments in the `myapp` namespace are performing — right now.”  
It’s your first stop for debugging latency, errors, or traffic issues in a Linkerd-meshed cluster. 🚀
