### Do you mean we ingest data through Kafka and then it is processed and stored in mongodb collectons.

Yes, exactly! Here's a simplified flow of how **Atlas Stream Processing** works when integrated with **Kafka** and **MongoDB**:

---

### **ðŸ“¥ Ingestion via Kafka**
- **Producers** (e.g., apps, sensors, services) send data to **Kafka topics**.
- Atlas Stream Processing uses a `$source` stage to **consume** this data in real time.

---

### **ðŸ”„ Processing in Atlas**
- The data flows through a **stream processor**, which is a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.
- You can apply transformations like filtering (`$match`), reshaping (`$project`), grouping (`$group`), and more.
- You can also validate data and handle errors using a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.

---

### **ðŸ“¦ Storage in MongoDB**
- After processing, the data is written to **MongoDB collections** using the `$merge` stage.
- This makes the data immediately available for querying, analytics, dashboards, or further processing.

---

### **Optional: Emitting to Kafka**
- You can also send processed data **back to Kafka** using `$emit`, if other systems need to consume it.
