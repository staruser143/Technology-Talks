### Query
* We have chosen MongoDB Atlas as the datastore for event and domain collections for the event driven system we are building based on Event Sourcing and CQRS and want to use Mongo Change Streams in a microservice to build Read Model in domain collections based on projections from change streams.
* Our Web workloads are running in AKS in Azure. We run multiple instances of microservice for HA, but we see that the changes are sent and processed by all instances of microservices which results in duplicate processing and performance degradation.We are looking for options to address this challenge. 

We have considered the 5 approaches as below. I want to know pros and cons of each approach and which one could be a better approach to handle the challenges we are facing.

Please consider each of the approach and let me know. If there is any other approach other than what I have presented do also let me know on that.

1.  Customize Mongo Change Streams with custom code which addresses some of the limitations in Mongo Change Streams.
2.  Leverage Mongo Atlas Stream Processing which enhances Mongo Change Streams either with or without Kafka/Azure Event Hubs
3.  Use Kafka along with Atlas MongoDB to publish events to Kafka and from there process it accordinglly using multiple consumers in a load balanced manner
4.  Use Azure Event Hubs with Atlas MongoDB , similar to Kafka but as a Managed Service than OpenSource Kafka which we have to manage ourselves, but provides interoperabiity because web workloads are already in AKS in Azure
5.  Use Confluent Kafka along with Atlas MongoDB, similar to Azure Event Hubs, but not without vendor-lock-in like Azure Event Hubs.


### Response

Based on your architecture (Event Sourcing/CQRS with MongoDB Atlas and AKS in Azure), the duplicate processing issue arises because **all microservice instances independently consume the same Change Stream events**.

Below is a detailed analysis of your proposed approaches, including alternatives, with recommendations:_

### üìä **Recommendation Summary**
| **Approach**               | **Details**               | **Cons**           | *Best For**    |
|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **1. Customize Mongo Change Streams with Custom Code**               | ‚ùå (High risk)         | High               | Low            |
| **Atlas Stream Processing**| ‚úÖ                     | Low                | Medium         |
| Self-Managed Kafka         | ‚úÖ                     | High               | Medium/High    |
| **Azure Event Hubs**       | ‚úÖ                     | **Low**            | Medium         |
| Confluent Cloud            | ‚úÖ                     | Low                | High           |


### üõ† **1. Customize Mongo Change Streams with Custom Code**  
**Approach**: Implement leader election or distributed locking (e.g., using Redis or ZooKeeper) to ensure only one instance processes events at a time.  
**Pros**:  
- Minimal infrastructure changes; works within existing MongoDB setup .  
- Low cost if leveraging existing tools (e.g., Azure Cache for Redis).  
**Cons**:  
- Adds complexity: Failover handling, lock expiration, and recovery logic must be robust .  
- Scalability bottlenecks: Lock contention may occur under high load.  
- Risk of data loss: Crashes during processing may require idempotent reprocessing logic.  
**Best for**: Simple setups with low event volumes where infrastructure simplicity is prioritized.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **2. Leverage Atlas Stream Processing**  
**Approach**: Use Atlas Stream Processing (ASP) to transform Change Streams server-side, outputting to a Kafka topic or materialized view. Microservices then consume pre-processed data.  
**Pros**:  
- **Eliminates duplicates**: ASP acts as a single processor, decoupling producers/consumers .  
- **Simplifies code**: Offloads aggregation/filtering to ASP (e.g., using `$match` or `$project`) .  
- **Integrated security**: Supports Azure Private Link and VPC peering .  
**Cons**:  
- Vendor lock-in: Requires MongoDB Atlas.  
- Cost: ASP tier pricing (e.g., SP10 starts at ~$0.30/hr) .  
- Learning curve: New syntax for stream pipelines.  
**Best for**: Teams committed to MongoDB ecosystem seeking minimal operational overhead.

---

### üîÑ **3. Use Kafka with Atlas MongoDB**  
**Approach**: Deploy Kafka, use the MongoDB Kafka Connector to publish Change Streams to topics. Microservices consume via consumer groups (load-balanced partitions).  
**Pros**:  
- **Guaranteed single delivery**: Kafka consumer groups distribute partitions across instances .  
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable brokers/consumers.  
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex topologies (e.g., reprocessing, multi-subscriber).  
**Cons**:  
- **Operational overhead**: Self-managed Kafka requires monitoring, scaling, and tuning .  
- **Infrastructure costs**: Azure VMs + storage for Kafka cluster.  
- **Complex setup**: Connector configuration, SSL/SASL auth .  
**Best for**: High-throughput scenarios where Kafka expertise exists.

---

### ‚ö° **4. Use Azure Event Hubs**  
**Approach**: Replace Kafka with Azure Event Hubs (Kafka-compatible endpoint). Use the same MongoDB Kafka Connector.  
**Pros**:  
- **Fully managed**: No cluster operations; auto-scaling .  
- **Azure-native integration**: Seamless with AKS (VNet injection, Managed Identities).  
- **Lower latency**: Collocated in Azure regions .  
**Cons**:  
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tightly coupled with Azure.  
- **Limited Kafka features**: Missing exactly-once semantics, tiered storage .  
**Best for**: Azure-centric teams prioritizing operational simplicity.

---

### üöÄ **5. Use Confluent Kafka**  
**Approach**: Use Confluent Cloud (managed Kafka) with MongoDB Connector.  
**Pros**:  
- **Enterprise features**: Schema Registry, KSQL, exactly-once delivery.  
- **Global availability**: Multi-region deployments.  
- **Simplified networking**: Supports AWS/Azure Private Link .  
**Cons**:  
- **High cost**: ~$0.50/GB throughput (vs. Event Hubs ~$0.05/GB).  
- **Vendor dependency**: Migration complexity if leaving Confluent.  
**Best for**: Organizations needing advanced Kafka capabilities without self-management.

---

### üîç **Other Approaches**  
- **Atlas App Services Triggers**:  
  - Sync Change Streams to Azure Event Grid via HTTPS.  
  - Pros: Serverless, low-code.  
  - Cons: Limited throughput; ordering issues during bursts .  
- **Materialized Views**:  
  - Use MongoDB Views to pre-aggregate read models .  
  - Pros: No external systems; uses native MongoDB.  
  - Cons: Not real-time; unsuitable for complex projections.

| **Approach**               | **Duplicate Handling** | **Ops Complexity** | **Cost**       | **Azure Fit** |
|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Custom Code                | ‚ùå (High risk)         | High               | Low            | Low           |
| **Atlas Stream Processing**| ‚úÖ                     | Low                | Medium         | Medium        |
| Self-Managed Kafka         | ‚úÖ                     | High               | Medium/High    | Medium        |
| **Azure Event Hubs**       | ‚úÖ                     | **Low**            | Medium         | **High**      |
| Confluent Cloud            | ‚úÖ                     | Low                | High           | Medium        |

1. **For Azure-optimized workloads**: **Azure Event Hubs** (Approach #4) is ideal. It integrates natively with AKS, reduces ops burden, and leverages your existing Azure investment .  
2. **For MongoDB-centric teams**: **Atlas Stream Processing** (Approach #2) simplifies architecture but adds Atlas dependency.  
3. **Avoid custom code**: It introduces fragility and scalability risks .

---

### üí° **Implementation Tips**
- **Collocate services**: Ensure ASP/Kafka/Event Hubs are in the same region as Atlas and AKS to reduce latency .  
- **Enable idempotency**: Design consumers to handle duplicate events (e.g., via `_id` deduplication).  
- **Monitor lag**: Track Change Stream/Kafka consumer lag with Atlas Metrics or Azure Monitor.  

By adopting Azure Event Hubs or Atlas Stream Processing, you‚Äôll resolve duplicates while aligning with your cloud strategy. For further optimization, test burst handling (e.g., 50K updates) with Atlas dedicated clusters .
