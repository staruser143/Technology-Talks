# What is Atlas Stream Processing and how does it work?

**Atlas Stream Processing** is a fully managed service by MongoDB that enables developers to process real-time data streams using the familiar MongoDB Query API. It’s designed to simplify the development of event-driven applications by allowing continuous ingestion, transformation, and analysis of streaming data—without the delays of traditional batch processing [1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-stream-processing/overview/) [2](https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/course/atlas-stream-processing/learning-byte/learn) [3](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-stream-processing).

### **How Atlas Stream Processing Works**

Here’s a breakdown of its core components and workflow:

#### **1. Stream Processor**
- The central unit of Atlas Stream Processing is the **stream processor**, which is essentially a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that continuously operates on streaming data.
- It starts with a `$source` stage (e.g., Kafka topic or MongoDB change stream), processes data through various stages, and ends with either:
  - `$emit` (to external systems like Kafka), or
  - `$merge` (to MongoDB collections).

#### **2. Processing Stages**
- **Validation**: `$validate` stage ensures schema correctness and can route invalid documents to a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.
- **Stateless Operations**: Transformations like `$match`, `$project`, etc., that act on individual records.
- **Stateful Operations**: Require **windowing** (e.g., `$group`, `$avg`) to operate on bounded sets of data over time intervals.

#### **3. Stream Processing Instance**
- Each instance includes:
  - **Workers**: Provide compute resources.
  - **Connection Registry**: Stores source/sink configurations.
  - **Security Context**: Manages access control.
  - **Cloud Provider & Region**: Supports AWS and Azure.

#### **4. Checkpointing**
- Atlas captures the state of stream processors using **checkpoint documents**, enabling recovery and resumption after failures without reprocessing all data [1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-stream-processing/overview/).

#### **5. Integration**
- Seamlessly integrates with **Apache Kafka** and MongoDB collections.
- Developers can use the same query language and data model across streaming and static data.

#### **6. Use Cases**
- Real-time analytics
- Personalized customer experiences
- Predictive maintenance
- Fraud detection
- IoT sensor data processing

### **Example Pipeline**
```javascript
[
  { $source: { connectionName: 'kafkaprod', topic: 'stocks' } },
  { $match: { exchange: 'NYSE' } },
  { $merge: { into: { connectionName: 'mongoprod', db: 'StockDB', col: 'TransactionHistory' } } }
]
```
