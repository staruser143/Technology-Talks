Yes, that's a very important aspect of MongoDB's transaction capabilities. To clarify:
 * Transactions Across Collections:
   * MongoDB transactions absolutely support operations that span multiple collections. This is a core part of their multi-document transaction functionality.
 * Transactions Across Databases:
   * Furthermore, MongoDB's distributed transactions extend to operations that involve multiple databases within the same MongoDB deployment (such as within a replica set or sharded cluster).
This ability to perform transactions across collections and databases is what makes MongoDB suitable for applications that require complex data manipulations and strict data integrity. Key points to remember:
 * Distributed Transactions:
   * The capability to perform transactions across multiple databases and collections is a feature of MongoDB's distributed transactions.
 * ACID Properties:
   * These transactions maintain ACID properties, ensuring that even when operations span multiple collections and databases, data consistency is preserved.
Therefore, you can confidently use MongoDB transactions to manage complex operations that involve data spread across different collections and even databases.


import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectConnection } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Connection, ClientSession } from 'mongoose';

@Injectable()
export class TransactionService {
  constructor(@InjectConnection() private connection: Connection) {}

  async performCrossCollectionTransaction(
    document1: any,
    document2: any,
  ): Promise<void> {
    const session: ClientSession = await this.connection.startSession();
    session.startTransaction();

    try {
      const collection1 = this.connection.collection('collection1');
      const collection2 = this.connection.collection('collection2');

      await collection1.insertOne(document1, { session });
      await collection2.insertOne(document2, { session });

      await session.commitTransaction();
      session.endSession();
    } catch (error) {
      await session.abortTransaction();
      session.endSession();
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async performCrossDatabaseTransaction(
    document1: any,
    document2: any,
  ): Promise<void> {
    const session: ClientSession = await this.connection.startSession();
    session.startTransaction();

    try {
      const db1 = this.connection.db('database1');
      const db2 = this.connection.db('database2');

      const collection1 = db1.collection('collection1');
      const collection2 = db2.collection('collection2');

      await collection1.insertOne(document1, { session });
      await collection2.insertOne(document2, { session });

      await session.commitTransaction();
      session.endSession();
    } catch (error) {
      await session.abortTransaction();
      session.endSession();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// Example usage within a NestJS controller or service:
// Assuming document1 and document2 are objects containing data to insert.
//
// async someFunction() {
//   await this.transactionService.performCrossCollectionTransaction(document1, document2);
//   await this.transactionService.performCrossDatabaseTransaction(document1, document2);
// }

Explanation and Key Considerations:
 * @nestjs/mongoose and mongoose:
   * This example relies on the @nestjs/mongoose module for MongoDB integration within NestJS.
   * It also uses the mongoose library for interacting with MongoDB.
 * @InjectConnection():
   * The @InjectConnection() decorator injects the default Mongoose connection into the service.
 * ClientSession:
   * ClientSession is crucial for managing transactions.
   * connection.startSession() initiates a new session.
   * session.startTransaction() begins the transaction.
   * session.commitTransaction() commits the changes.
   * session.abortTransaction() rolls back the changes if an error occurs.
   * session.endSession() closes the session.
 * performCrossCollectionTransaction():
   * This method demonstrates a transaction that spans two collections (collection1 and collection2) within the same database.
   * The session is passed as an option to the insertOne() operation, ensuring that the operations are part of the transaction.
 * performCrossDatabaseTransaction():
   * This method shows a transaction that spans two different databases (database1 and database2).
   * connection.db('databaseName') is used to get a database object, and then collections are accessed from that database object.
   * Again, the session option is used to include the operations in the transaction.
 * Error Handling:
   * The try...catch block ensures that if an error occurs during the transaction, the abortTransaction() method is called to roll back any changes.
   * It is very important to properly handle errors, to prevent data corruption.
 * Atlas Considerations:
   * This code will work seamlessly with MongoDB Atlas, provided you have configured your NestJS application to connect to your Atlas cluster.
   * Ensure that your Atlas cluster meets the feature compatibility version requirements for transactions (4.0 for replica sets, 4.2 for sharded clusters).
 * Important Notes:
   * Always handle possible errors. If a network error, or another problem happens during the transaction, and you do not handle the error, the transaction may remain open.
   * For sharded clusters, be aware of the sharding key. If you are doing transactions across shards, the sharding key will have an impact on performance.
   * Ensure that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is of a sufficient size to handle the load of your transactions.
This detailed example and explanation should provide a solid foundation for implementing cross-collection and cross-database transactions in your NestJS applications using MongoDB Atlas.


It's important to clarify that MongoDB doesn't have "stored procedures" in the traditional relational database sense. However, it provides alternative mechanisms that offer similar or even more powerful capabilities. Here's how MongoDB handles server-side logic and cross-database/collection operations:
Key Alternatives to Stored Procedures in MongoDB:
 * Atlas Functions:
   * MongoDB Atlas Functions allow you to write server-side JavaScript functions that can be executed directly within the Atlas environment.
   * These functions can access and manipulate data across multiple collections and databases within your Atlas cluster.
   * Atlas Functions run in a serverless environment, providing scalability and flexibility.
 * Aggregation Pipelines:
   * MongoDB's aggregation pipeline is a powerful tool for data processing and transformation.
   * It allows you to perform complex operations on data across collections, including filtering, grouping, and data transformations.
   * While not exactly "stored procedures," aggregation pipelines can encapsulate complex data logic.
 * Transactions:
   * As discussed earlier, MongoDB's distributed transactions provide ACID guarantees for operations that span multiple collections and databases.
   * You can use transactions to ensure data consistency when performing complex operations that involve multiple collections or databases.
 * Triggers:
   * MongoDB Atlas Triggers allow you to execute Atlas Functions in response to database events, such as document insertions, updates, or deletions. This allows for automated server side logic.
Regarding Cross-Database and Collection Operations:
 * Atlas Functions and aggregation pipelines can readily work with data across multiple collections and databases.
 * When combined with transactions, you can ensure that these operations are performed atomically, maintaining data integrity.
Important Considerations:
 * While you can achieve similar functionality to stored procedures, MongoDB's approach emphasizes flexibility and scalability through its serverless architecture and powerful data processing tools.
 * When designing your application, consider whether Atlas Functions, aggregation pipelines, or a combination of both is the most appropriate solution for your needs.
 * It is important to remember that heavy server side javascript usage can impact performance. So testing is very important.
In summary, while traditional stored procedures aren't a direct feature, MongoDB Atlas provides robust alternatives that can handle complex server-side logic and cross-database/collection operations effectively.
