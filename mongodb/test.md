### Query: 
When using a collection in MongoDB Atlas data store as an event store collection, would the be events appended to the event store collection in order and also fetched in same order.

### Response: 
In MongoDB, documents in a collection are not guaranteed to be stored or retrieved in insertion order unless you explicitly specify an order when querying.

**Appending Events:**
- Events are appended (inserted) to the collection, but MongoDB does not guarantee physical order on disk.

**Fetching Events in Order:**
- To fetch events in the same order as they were appended, you must include an ordering field (like a timestamp or an incrementing sequence number) in each event document.
- When querying, use `.find().sort({ timestamp: 1 })` or `.find().sort({ sequenceNumber: 1 })` to ensure correct order.

**Summary:**  
Events are not guaranteed to be stored or fetched in order unless you explicitly sort by an ordering field when querying.

### Query:
If I have an event structure with fields like eventId,aggregateId,timestamp,eventName and also including the event specific fields, where eventId woudl be unique. Every aggregateId can have multiple eventId's associated with it as separate events. In this scenario, do we still need sequenceNo field to be added.

### Response: 
Yes, it is recommended to add a **sequenceNo** (or similar) field for each event per aggregate, even if you have `timestamp` and `eventId`.

**Why?**
- **eventId** is globally unique, but does not guarantee order within an aggregate.
- **timestamp** can have collisions (multiple events at the same millisecond) or be affected by clock skew.
- **sequenceNo** is a strictly incrementing integer per `aggregateId`, ensuring a clear, unambiguous order of events for each aggregate.

**Typical usage:**
- When fetching events for an aggregate, you query by `aggregateId` and sort by `sequenceNo` to replay events in the correct order.

**Summary:**  
Adding a `sequenceNo` per aggregate is best practice for event sourcing, as it guarantees event order and simplifies event replay logic.

### Query: 
Do we need to add logic to check if sequenceNo field is in increasing order to what is already appened for an aggregateId when appending event to event store colelction.

### Response: 
Yes, you should add logic to ensure that the `sequenceNo` for a new event is strictly greater than the highest `sequenceNo` already stored for that `aggregateId`. This prevents concurrency issues and maintains the correct event order.

**How to do this:**
- Before inserting a new event, fetch the current highest `sequenceNo` for the given `aggregateId`.
- Set the new event’s `sequenceNo` to `currentMax + 1`.
- Alternatively, use an atomic operation (like a unique index on `{aggregateId, sequenceNo}`) to prevent duplicates or out-of-order inserts.

**Summary:**  
Yes, always ensure `sequenceNo` is strictly increasing for each `aggregateId` to maintain event consistency and order.

### Query:
Do we mean if we create an unique index on (aggregateId,sequenceNo) we do not need to add any logic to check for increasign sequenceNo

### Response: Creating a unique index on `(aggregateId, sequenceNo)` in MongoDB **prevents duplicate sequence numbers** for the same aggregate, but it does **not** automatically ensure that `sequenceNo` values are strictly increasing or sequential.

**What the unique index does:**
- Guarantees that you cannot insert two events with the same `aggregateId` and `sequenceNo`.

**What it does NOT do:**
- It does not check if the new `sequenceNo` is exactly one greater than the previous highest for that `aggregateId`.
- It does not prevent gaps or out-of-order inserts if your application logic is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**  
You still need application logic to ensure that `sequenceNo` is strictly increasing for each `aggregateId`. The unique index only prevents duplicates, not ordering mistakes.

### Query:
What if we checked the added logic but just before insert time ,some other event already gets appended to same aggregateId with different sequenceNo, what should we do in that scenario.

### Response:
This is a classic **concurrency problem** in event sourcing. If two processes try to append events to the same `aggregateId` at the same time, both might read the same latest `sequenceNo` and try to insert the next one, causing a conflict.

**What happens:**
- Both processes read the same latest `sequenceNo` (e.g., 5).
- Both try to insert an event with `sequenceNo` 6.
- The unique index on `(aggregateId, sequenceNo)` causes one insert to succeed and the other to fail with a duplicate key error.

**What should you do?**
- **Handle the duplicate key error:**  
  If your insert fails due to a duplicate key error, catch the error, re-fetch the latest `sequenceNo`, and retry the insert with the correct next value.
- **Optimistic concurrency control:**  
  This pattern is called optimistic concurrency. You assume no conflict, but handle it if it occurs.

**Summary:**  
You must handle insert failures due to concurrency by catching the error, reloading the latest state, and retrying the operation. This ensures consistency even under concurrent writes.

### Query: 
Can you provide code to understand what needs to be done when using NestJS with MongoDB Atlas event store collection.

### Response:
Certainly! Here’s a simplified example of how you might implement optimistic concurrency for appending events to an event store collection in NestJS with MongoDB (using Mongoose):

````typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import { Event, EventDocument } from './schemas/event.schema';

@Injectable()
export class EventStoreService {
  constructor(
    @InjectModel(Event.name) private eventModel: Model<EventDocument>,
  ) {}

  async appendEvent(aggregateId: string, eventData: Partial<Event>) {
    let retry = 0;
    const maxRetries = 3;

    while (retry < maxRetries) {
      // 1. Get the latest sequenceNo for the aggregateId
      const lastEvent = await this.eventModel
        .findOne({ aggregateId })
        .sort({ sequenceNo: -1 })
        .lean();

      const nextSequenceNo = lastEvent ? lastEvent.sequenceNo + 1 : 1;

      // 2. Prepare the new event
      const newEvent = new this.eventModel({
        ...eventData,
        aggregateId,
        sequenceNo: nextSequenceNo,
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

      try {
        // 3. Try to insert the new event
        await newEvent.save();
        return newEvent;
      } catch (err) {
        // 4. If duplicate key error, retry
        if (err.code === 11000) {
          retry++;
          continue;
        }
        throw err;
      }
    }

    throw new Error('Failed to append event after multiple retries due to concurrency.');
  }
}
````

**Notes:**
- This code assumes you have a unique index on `{ aggregateId, sequenceNo }` in your MongoDB collection.
- The `Event` schema should include `aggregateId`, `sequenceNo`, and other event fields.
- The method retries the insert if a duplicate key error occurs (due to a race condition).
- For production, consider using transactions or more robust retry/backoff strategies.

Let me know if you need the schema definition or more details!

### Query: How can I use transactions and at the same time ensure it is robust with retry/backoff strategies.

### Response: To use transactions with MongoDB in NestJS (with Mongoose) and ensure robustness with retry/backoff, you can:

1. **Start a session and transaction** for each append operation.
2. **Read the latest sequenceNo** within the transaction.
3. **Insert the new event** with the next sequenceNo.
4. **Commit the transaction**.
5. **On transient errors (like write conflicts), retry** with exponential backoff.

Here’s a robust example:

````typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Model, Connection, startSession } from 'mongoose';
import { Event, EventDocument } from './schemas/event.schema';
import { InjectConnection } from '@nestjs/mongoose';

@Injectable()
export class EventStoreService {
  constructor(
    @InjectModel(Event.name) private eventModel: Model<EventDocument>,
    @InjectConnection() private readonly connection: Connection,
  ) {}

  async appendEventWithTransaction(
    aggregateId: string,
    eventData: Partial<Event>,
    maxRetries = 5,
  ) {
    let attempt = 0;
    let delay = 100; // ms

    while (attempt < maxRetries) {
      const session = await this.connection.startSession();
      session.startTransaction();
      try {
        // 1. Get latest sequenceNo within the transaction
        const lastEvent = await this.eventModel
          .findOne({ aggregateId })
          .sort({ sequenceNo: -1 })
          .session(session)
          .lean();

        const nextSequenceNo = lastEvent ? lastEvent.sequenceNo + 1 : 1;

        // 2. Prepare and insert the new event
        const newEvent = new this.eventModel({
          ...eventData,
          aggregateId,
          sequenceNo: nextSequenceNo,
          timestamp: new Date(),
        });

        await newEvent.save({ session });

        // 3. Commit transaction
        await session.commitTransaction();
        session.endSession();
        return newEvent;
      } catch (err) {
        await session.abortTransaction();
        session.endSession();

        // Retry on transient errors or duplicate key
        if (
          err.hasErrorLabel?.('TransientTransactionError') ||
          err.code === 112 || // WriteConflict
          err.code === 11000 // Duplicate key
        ) {
          attempt++;
          await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, delay));
          delay *= 2; // Exponential backoff
          continue;
        }
        throw err;
      }
    }
    throw new Error('Failed to append event after multiple retries.');
  }
}
````

**Key points:**
- Uses MongoDB transactions for atomicity.
- Retries on transient errors and duplicate key errors.
- Implements exponential backoff between retries.
- Requires MongoDB replica set or Atlas cluster for transactions.

**Tip:**  
For high-throughput systems, consider batching or using a more advanced concurrency control pattern.

### Query: Can you explain how transaction is helpful for this scenario.

### Response: A **transaction** in MongoDB ensures that a series of operations are executed atomically—either all succeed or none do. In the context of appending events to an event store:

### Why transactions help:

1. **Atomicity:**  
   Reading the latest `sequenceNo` and inserting the new event happen together. No other operation can interleave and cause inconsistent state within the transaction.

2. **Consistency:**  
   If two processes try to append events to the same `aggregateId` at the same time, only one transaction will succeed. The other will detect a conflict (e.g., duplicate key or write conflict) and can retry safely.

3. **Isolation:**  
   Other operations outside the transaction cannot see intermediate states, preventing race conditions and ensuring the correct order of events.

### Without transactions:
- There’s a risk that between reading the latest `sequenceNo` and inserting the new event, another process inserts an event, causing duplicate or out-of-order events.

### With transactions:
- The read and write are isolated and atomic, so you can safely guarantee event order and uniqueness per aggregate.

**Summary:**  
Transactions make your event appending logic robust against concurrency issues, ensuring correct event ordering and preventing data corruption.
