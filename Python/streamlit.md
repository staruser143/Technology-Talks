You're on the right track! 🎯

You're trying to run a **Streamlit app in Google Colab**, but you're running into issues because:

> ❌ **Streamlit doesn't run directly in Jupyter/Colab cells** like regular Python code.

But don't worry — **you CAN run Streamlit apps in Google Colab** with a few extra steps.

Let me show you exactly how to do it — step by step.

---

## ✅ How to Run Streamlit in Google Colab

### 🔧 Step 1: Create Your Streamlit App File

You need to save your `app.py` as a file in the Colab environment.

Run this in a **Colab cell**:

```python
%%writefile app.py

# --- Paste your full Streamlit app code here ---
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello from Colab!")
st.write("This is a test Streamlit app.")

# Replace this with your full summarizer code
```

✅ Replace the example above with your **full `app.py` code** (the one with Long-T5, PDF, URL, etc.).

> 💡 Pro tip: Use `%%writefile app.py` at the top of a cell to save everything below into a file.

---

### 🔧 Step 2: Install Required Packages

Run this in a new cell:

```python
!pip install streamlit torch transformers pypdf trafilatura nltk tiktoken
```

> ⚠️ This may take 2–5 minutes — Colab installs everything.

---

### 🔧 Step 3: Run Streamlit (with Ngrok for Tunneling)

Colab doesn’t expose ports directly, so we use **ngrok** to create a public URL.

Run this in a new cell:

```python
import os
import threading
import time
import subprocess

# Start Streamlit in a background thread
def run_streamlit():
    os.system("streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501")

# Start Streamlit
threading.Thread(target=run_streamlit).start()

# Wait for Streamlit to start
time.sleep(5)

# Install and run ngrok
!ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN  # ← Replace with your token!

# Start ngrok tunnel
!npx ngrok http 8501
```

---

### 🔑 Step 3.1: Get Your Ngrok Token

1. Go to: [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. Sign up (free)
3. Copy your **Auth Token** (looks like `2f2a3b4c5d6e7f8g9h0i1j2k3l`)

Then replace:

```python
!ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
```

with:

```python
!ngrok authtoken 2f2a3b4c5d6e7f8g9h0i1j2k3l  # ← Your real token
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Get the Public URL

After running the last cell, you’ll see output like:

```
Session Status                online
Session Expires               1 hour, 59 minutes
Version                       3.0.0
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://abcd-12-34-56-789.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8501
```

👉 Click the `https://abcd-...ngrok.io` link — that’s your **live Streamlit app**!

## 🧩 Full Working Example (Copy-Paste Ready)

```python
# Cell 1: Save the app
%%writefile app.py
import streamlit as st
st.title("🎉 Hello from Streamlit in Colab!")
st.write("If you see this, it's working!")
```

```python
# Cell 2: Install packages
!pip install streamlit
```

```python
# Cell 3: Run Streamlit + Ngrok
import threading
import time
import os

def run_app():
    os.system("streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501")

threading.Thread(target=run_app).start()
time.sleep(3)

!pip install pyngrok -q
from pyngrok import ngrok

# Set your ngrok token (get it from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
ngrok.set_auth_token("your_ngrok_auth_token_here")

# Open tunnel
public_url = ngrok.connect(8501)
st.write(f"🌟 Your app is live at: {public_url}")
```

> Wait for the output — then click the link!

## 🚫 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `Command not found: streamlit` | Make sure you ran `!pip install streamlit` |
| App doesn’t load | Wait 10–20 sec for model to load (especially Long-T5) |
| Ngrok error | Check your auth token is correct |
| Colab disconnects | Use **Colab Pro** for longer sessions, or run in background |
| Long-T5 too slow on CPU | Use `google-t5/t5-small` for testing |

---

## ✅ Pro Tips

### 💡 Use `st.cache_resource` and `st.cache_data` to speed things up
```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    return pipeline("summarization", model="pszemraj/long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary")
```

### 💡 Save your notebook with all cells — no need to re-run every time

### 💡 For faster testing, use a smaller model:
```python
model = "t5-small"  # Fast on CPU
```

## ✅ Alternative: Use **Streamlit Community Cloud** (Free & Easier)

Instead of Colab, deploy directly:

1. Save your code to a **GitHub repo**
2. Go to [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Connect your repo
4. Deploy in 1 click

✅ No ngrok, no Colab timeouts  
✅ Always on  
✅ Free for public repos

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Now you can:
- ✅ Run full Streamlit apps in Google Colab
- ✅ Test your AI summarizer with PDF/URL support
- ✅ Share it via ngrok or deploy on Streamlit Cloud

Let me know:
- If you want a **ready-to-upload GitHub repo template**
- How to **add authentication** or **file persistence**
- Or how to **speed up Long-T5** with quantization

You're building something powerful — keep going! 🚀🧠
