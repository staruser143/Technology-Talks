The error you're seeing:

```
LookupError: Resource punkt_tab not found.
Please use the NLTK Downloader to obtain the resource:
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

is **not correct** — there is **no such resource as `'punkt_tab'`** in NLTK.

This appears to be a **corrupted or mistaken resource name**, possibly due to:
- A typo in code
- A misconfigured model or tokenizer
- HTML/color formatting (`[93m`, `[0m`) leaking into the error (common in terminals or logs)

Let’s **diagnose and fix** this properly.

---

### ✅ Correct Resource Name: `'punkt'` (Not `'punkt_tab'`)

NLTK uses the **`punkt`** tokenizer for sentence splitting. There is **no `punkt_tab`**.

✅ You should download:

```python
nltk.download('punkt')
```

not `punkt_tab`.

---

### ✅ Why This Error Happens

1. **You (or a library) tried to load a non-existent resource**  
   Example:
   ```python
   nltk.data.find('tokenizers/punkt_tab/english')  # ❌ This doesn't exist
   ```

2. **Color codes in terminal logs**  
   The `[93m`, `[0m` are **ANSI color codes** that sometimes appear in logs or Jupyter/Colab if output isn’t handled cleanly.

   What you’re seeing:
   ```
   Resource [93mpunkt_tab[0m not found
   ```
   Should actually be:
   > Resource **punkt** not found

   But due to formatting or a bug, it became `punkt_tab`.

3. **Typo in code or config file**  
   Someone may have accidentally written `'punkt_tab'` instead of `'punkt'`.

---

### ✅ How to Fix It

#### ✅ Step 1: Download the Correct Resource

Run this in your Python environment (Colab, Jupyter, terminal):

```python
import nltk

# Download the correct tokenizer
nltk.download('punkt')
```

> This installs the **Punkt sentence tokenizer**, used by `nltk.sent_tokenize()`.

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Test It

```python
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

text = "Hello world. This is a test sentence."
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
print(sentences)
```

Expected output:
```python
['Hello world.', 'This is a test sentence.']
```

✅ If this works — you’re fixed!

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Ensure It’s Available Across Sessions

NLTK looks for data in specific directories. If you're in **Google Colab** or a fresh environment, run `nltk.download()` every time, or ensure the data is saved in a persistent path.

In Colab, you can do:

```python
nltk.download('punkt', download_dir='/content/nltk_data')
nltk.data.path.append('/content/nltk_data')
```

But usually, just `nltk.download('punkt')` is enough.

---

### 🛠️ Pro Tip: Handle It Gracefully in Your App

Wrap it in a try-except to avoid crashes:

```python
import nltk

try:
    nltk.data.find('tokenizers/punkt')
except LookupError:
    nltk.download('punkt')

# Now safe to use
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
```

---

### 📚 Reference

As per the [NLTK Data Documentation](https://www.nltk.org/data.html):
- Use `nltk.download()` to install packages.
- Use `nltk.download('punkt')` for sentence tokenization.
- Resources like `punkt`, `stopwords`, `wordnet` are valid — `punkt_tab` is **not**.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Issue | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `punkt_tab` not found | ❌ It doesn't exist |
| You need `punkt` | ✅ Run `nltk.download('punkt')` |
| Color codes in error | Ignore `[93m`, `[0m` — they’re formatting artifacts |
| App breaking | Add try-except or pre-download |

---

✅ **Final Fix in One Block:**

```python
import nltk

# Safe download
try:
    nltk.data.find('tokenizers/punkt')
except LookupError:
    nltk.download('punkt')
```

Now your app will **work reliably** in Colab, Streamlit, or any environment.

Let me know if you want to auto-download multiple resources (`punkt`, `stopwords`, etc.)!
