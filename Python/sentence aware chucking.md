Great question! 🎯

**Overlap + sentence-aware splitting** is a smart way to break long text into chunks **without cutting sentences in the middle** and **while preserving context** between chunks.

Let’s break it down — what it is, why it matters, and how it improves summarization.

---

## 🔍 What Is Overlap + Sentence-Aware Splitting?

### 1. **Sentence-Aware Splitting**
Instead of splitting text every N **characters** or **tokens** (which can cut a sentence like this):

> "The experiment showed significant results that could change how we understand climate change. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings."  
→ Split here ⬇️  
> "The experiment showed significant results that could change how we understand climate change. However, further resear"  
> "ch is needed to confirm these findings."

❌ This hurts understanding.

✅ **Sentence-aware splitting** breaks text **only at sentence boundaries** (after `.`, `?`, `!`), so no sentence is split.

---

### 2. **Overlap**
Even if you split at sentence boundaries, adjacent chunks may **lose context**.

Example:
- Chunk 1 ends with: *"The patient was given Drug A."*
- Chunk 2 starts with: *"Symptoms improved within 48 hours."*

❓ Is the improvement due to Drug A? Hard to tell without context.

✅ **Overlap** means repeating the **last sentence(s)** of one chunk at the start of the next:

> Chunk 1:  
> ...The patient was given Drug A. Symptoms improved within 48 hours.

> Chunk 2 (with 1-sentence overlap):  
> The patient was given Drug A. Symptoms improved within 48 hours.  
> Follow-up tests confirmed no side effects...

Now Chunk 2 has context — the improvement is linked to Drug A.

## ✅ Why Is This Important for Summarization?

When you summarize long documents in chunks, poor splitting leads to:

| Problem | Cause | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ❌ Incomplete understanding | Sentence cut mid-way | Model misses key info |
| ❌ Lost context between sections | No overlap | Summaries lack coherence |
| ❌ Redundancy or gaps | Poor chunk boundaries | Final summary is inconsistent |

With **sentence-aware + overlap**, you get:
- ✅ Clean, readable chunks
- ✅ Preserved context
- ✅ Better mini-summaries
- ✅ Smoother final "reduce" step

➡️ **Better overall summary quality**

## ✅ How to Implement It (Code Example)

Here’s a robust function that does both:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
import tiktoken

nltk.download('punkt', quiet=True)

def split_text_with_overlap(
    text: str,
    max_tokens: int = 900,
    overlap_sentences: int = 1,
    model_name: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
):
    """
    Splits text into chunks by sentences, with optional sentence overlap.
    
    Args:
        text: Input long text
        max_tokens: Max tokens per chunk (e.g., 900 for BART)
        overlap_sentences: Number of sentences to carry over (usually 1)
        model_name: Tokenizer model (for accurate count)
    
    Returns:
        List of text chunks
    """
    # Load tokenizer
    try:
        encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model_name)
    except KeyError:
        encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")

    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_token_count = 0

    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        sentence_token_count = len(encoding.encode(sentence))

        # If adding this sentence exceeds limit, save current chunk
        if current_token_count + sentence_token_count > max_tokens and current_chunk:
            # Save current chunk
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))

            # Start new chunk with overlap
            if overlap_sentences > 0:
                overlap_start = max(0, len(current_chunk) - overlap_sentences)
                new_chunk = current_chunk[overlap_start:]
            else:
                new_chunk = []

            current_chunk = new_chunk + [sentence]
            # Recalculate token count for new chunk
            current_token_count = len(encoding.encode(" ".join(current_chunk)))
        else:
            current_chunk.append(sentence)
            current_token_count += sentence_token_count

    # Add last chunk
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))

    return chunks
```

## ✅ Example Usage

```python
text = """
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. 
It concerns the interaction between computers and human language. 
One major application is machine translation. Google Translate uses advanced NLP models. 
These models are trained on vast amounts of text data. 
Training requires powerful GPUs and large datasets. 
Without sufficient data, models fail to generalize. 
Generalization is key to handling unseen inputs. 
This is why data quality matters as much as quantity.
"""

chunks = split_text_with_overlap(text, max_tokens=100, overlap_sentences=1)

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"\n--- Chunk {i+1} ---")
    print(chunk)
```

### Output:
```
--- Chunk 1 ---

One major application is machine translation. Google Translate uses advanced NLP models.

--- Chunk 2 ---

--- Chunk 3 ---

✅ No broken sentences  
✅ Overlap preserves context (e.g., "Google Translate..." appears in both chunks)

## ✅ When Should You Use It?

| Use Case | Recommended? |
|--------|--------------|
| Research papers | ✅ Yes — preserve technical flow |
| Legal documents | ✅ Yes — context is critical |
| Books / Novels | ✅ Yes — narrative continuity |
| Short articles (<1000 words) | ❌ No — direct summarization is fine |
| Scanned PDFs with OCR noise | ⚠️ Maybe — clean first |

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | Benefit |
|-------|--------|
| ✂️ Sentence-aware splitting | No broken sentences → better comprehension |
| 🔁 Overlap (1–2 sentences) | Preserves context between chunks |
| 🧠 Better summaries | Each mini-summary has enough context |
| 🔄 Improved final summary | Coherent, accurate, and complete |

### 💡 Pro Tip:
For **very long documents**, combine this with:
- Named entity tracking
- Section-based splitting (e.g., split by "Introduction", "Methods")
- Or use **LangChain’s** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`

Let me know if you want:
- A full Streamlit app with this splitting method
- Support for section-aware splitting (e.g., by headings)
- Comparison of different overlap strategies

You're building a professional-grade summarizer — this level of detail makes a real difference! 🚀
