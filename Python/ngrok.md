Perfect! 😊 Yes, you **do need `ngrok`** (not "Grok") to run a **Streamlit app in Google Colab**, and you're absolutely right to be setting it up.

Let me give you a **clear, step-by-step guide** to install and use `ngrok` in Google Colab — the **simplest and most reliable way** to run your Streamlit app with a live public link.

---

### ✅ Why You Need `ngrok` in Colab

Google Colab runs your code in a secure environment. When you run:

```python
streamlit run app.py
```

It starts a local server at `http://localhost:8501`, but **you can't access it directly** from your browser.

👉 `ngrok` creates a **public URL** (like `https://abcd-123.ngrok.io`) that **forwards to your local Streamlit server** — so you can view and interact with your app.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Install & Use `ngrok` in Colab

### 🔹 Step 1: Save Your Streamlit App

Run this in a cell to create your app file:

```python
%%writefile app.py
import streamlit as st

st.title("🎉 My AI Summarizer")
st.write("This app runs in Google Colab with ngrok!")
```

> Replace this with your full summarizer code later.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Install Required Packages

```python
!pip install streamlit pyngrok -q
```

> `-q` means "quiet" — hides long output.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Get Your `ngrok` Auth Token

1. Go to: [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. After logging in, go to:  
   🔗 [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
4. Copy your token (looks like):  
   `2f2a3b4c5d6e7f8g9h0i1j2k3l`

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Start Streamlit + Connect `ngrok`

Run this in a new cell:

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok
import threading
import time
import os

# Set your ngrok auth token (replace with your real token)
ngrok.set_auth_token("your_ngrok_auth_token_here")  # ← Paste your token here

# Function to run Streamlit
def run_streamlit():
    os.system("streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501")

# Start Streamlit in background
threading.Thread(target=run_streamlit).start()

# Wait a moment for Streamlit to start
time.sleep(2)

# Open ngrok tunnel
public_url = ngrok.connect(8501)
st_write = "🌟 Your Streamlit app is live at:"
print(f"{st_write} {public_url}")
```

✅ After running this, you’ll see a link like:

```
https://a1b2c3d4-5678.ngrok.io
```

👉 Click it — your Streamlit app will open in a new tab!

## 🛠️ Pro Tips

### 1. **Keep the runtime alive**
Colab disconnects after inactivity. To reduce disconnects:
- Use **Colab Pro**
- Or run this in a cell to prevent timeout:

```python
# Prevent Colab from disconnecting
import time
while True:
    time.sleep(300)
```

### 2. **Speed up startup**
Use caching for heavy models:

```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    return pipeline("summarization", model="pszemraj/long-t5-tglobal-base-16384-book-summary")
```

### 3. **Use a smaller model for testing**
If Long-T5 is too slow on CPU:

```python
model = "t5-small"  # Fast, lightweight
```

---

## 🧩 Full Minimal Working Example

```python
# Cell 1
%%writefile app.py
import streamlit as st
st.title("Hello from Colab!")
st.write("Streamlit + ngrok = 🔥")
```

```python
# Cell 2
!pip install streamlit pyngrok -q
```

```python
# Cell 3
from pyngrok import ngrok
import threading
import os

ngrok.set_auth_token("your_token_here")  # ← Replace!

def run_app():
    os.system("streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501")

threading.Thread(target=run_app).start()
ngrok.connect(8501)

print("🚀 App is live at: https://your-ngrok-link.ngrok.io")
```

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- ✅ `ngrok` is **required** to expose Streamlit in Colab
- ✅ It’s **free for basic use**
- ✅ The link expires when you stop the runtime
- ✅ For permanent hosting, use **Streamlit Community Cloud**

You're doing everything right — `ngrok` is the magic key to making your AI summarizer **accessible and shareable**. Keep going! 🚀
