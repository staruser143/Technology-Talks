## Does using Websockets for this usecase provide any benefits.
* Using WebSockets in this use case could offer benefits if real-time interaction is a priority.
* A breakdown of the potential advantages and whether they fit the scenario:

## Benefits of Using WebSockets
* **Real-Time Updates for Plan Recommendations:**
When a user answers questions, the filtering logic can run on the backend, and updates can be pushed immediately to the frontend without waiting for a new API call.
This could create a more dynamic and seamless user experience.

* **Efficient Data Flow:**
WebSockets establish a persistent connection between client and server. For frequent updates (e.g., filtering plans as users type or select answers), this avoids the overhead of repeatedly making HTTP requests.
This can be particularly useful if the filtering process is complex and involves multiple criteria.

* **Improved User Experience:**
Instantaneous updates without the need to refresh or manually trigger actions make the interface feel more responsive.
This could also apply to showing notifications (e.g., "We found new plans matching your criteria.").

# When to Use WebSockets Here
WebSockets are most beneficial if:
* We anticipate frequent updates to the plan listing based on user responses.
* The number of users interacting with the system concurrently isnâ€™t extremely high (WebSockets require server resources for persistent connections).
* Real-time interaction significantly enhances the user experience.

**Potential Downsides**

**Increased Complexity**: Implementing WebSockets will add complexity to both the frontend and backend, especially for managing connections, authentication, and scalability.

**Resource-Intensive**: Maintaining persistent connections for all users can strain server resources, especially with a large user base.

**Fallback Mechanism**: You'll still need to handle scenarios where WebSockets aren't supported (e.g., older browsers or network restrictions).

## Recommendation for the Use Case
* If the user experience demands dynamic, instant updates (e.g., showing plans as soon as an answer is selected), WebSockets can be advantageous.
* However, if users are okay with a slight delay (e.g., after clicking a "Filter" or "Recommend Plans" button), HTTP requests would suffice and simplify the implementation.


# Would there be a noticeable delay or page refresh when user answers the questions when not using websockets.
* No, there wouldn't necessarily be a noticeable delay or page refresh when users answer the questions, even without using WebSockets. 
* However, the experience largely depends on how efficiently the frontend and backend handle the request-response cycle. Here's why:

## Why No Page Refresh or Noticeable Delay?
AJAX Requests:
In modern web applications using ReactJS, asynchronous HTTP requests (via fetch or axios) can send user responses to the backend and update the UI dynamically without a full page reload.

**Optimized Backend:**

If the backend APIs are well-optimized (e.g., using indexed queries in MongoDB), the server can process filtering requests quickly, reducing the round-trip time.

**Frontend Loading Indicators:**

With proper UI feedback (e.g., loading spinners while fetching the filtered plans), the user won't experience a "delay" but rather a responsive application.

**Factors That Could Cause Delay**
**Complex Filtering Logic:**

If the backend filtering logic is computationally intensive or the dataset is large, it could slow down responses.
**Mitigation**: Use efficient queries and caching mechanisms like Redis.

**Slow Network:**

Users with slow internet connections may notice slight delays, **but debouncing requests (sending fewer API calls) can help.**

**Overloaded Backend:**

If the backend is overloaded due to high traffic, response times can increase.
**Mitigation**: Implement horizontal scaling or use a message queue like Kafka/Azure Event Grid.

**Enhancing Perceived Performance Without WebSockets**
* Even without WebSockets, we can make the user experience feel seamless:

**Preload Questions and Plans:**
Load all questions and a default set of plans when the page initializes.

**Client-Side Filters:**
Perform preliminary filtering on the frontend using JavaScript, and only call the backend for complex queries.

**Local Caching:**
Cache previous responses to avoid redundant API calls if the same criteria are submitted.

## Is WebSockets Worth the Tradeoff?
* If the users are satisfied with a slightly delayed "filter" or "apply" button experience, we likely don't need WebSockets.
* However, if we want instant feedback (e.g., plans updating dynamically while users interact with answers), WebSockets or other real-time solutions become valuable.
