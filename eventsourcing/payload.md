Storing the **complete data captured so far** (including data from all previously submitted pages) in each event payload can simplify the **event consumer's job** and reduce the need for additional lookups or knowledge of the quote structure. However, this approach has both **advantages** and **trade-offs**. Letâ€™s analyze this in detail.

---

### **Approach: Store Complete Data in Each Event**

In this approach, every time the user submits data from a page (e.g., updates the email address on the Personal Details page), the event payload includes **all data captured so far** across all pages (e.g., Personal Details, Dependent Details, Employment Details, etc.).

#### **Example: PersonalDetailsSaved Event**
- The user updates the email address on the Personal Details page.
- The event payload includes:
  - Updated personal details (with the new email address).
  - Data from previously submitted pages (e.g., Dependent Details, Employment Details).

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-005",
  "eventType": "PersonalDetailsSaved",
  "aggregateId": "quote-123",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:40:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "personalDetails": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "phone": "555-1234",
      "email": "john.doe.new@example.com"
    },
    "dependentDetails": {
      "dependents": [
        { "name": "Jane Doe", "relationship": "Spouse" },
        { "name": "Baby Doe", "relationship": "Child" }
      ]
    },
    "employmentDetails": {
      "employer": "Acme Corp",
      "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
      "income": 100000
    }
  }
}
```

### **Advantages of Storing Complete Data**

1. **Simpler Event Consumers**:
   - The event consumer does not need to perform additional lookups or know the structure of the quote.
   - It can directly update the read model in the domain data store using the complete data provided in the event.

2. **Self-Contained Events**:
   - Each event contains all the data required to update the read model, making the system more robust and easier to debug.

3. **No Need for State Reconstruction**:
   - Since the complete data is included in each event, there is no need to replay previous events to reconstruct the state.

4. **Easier Auditing**:
   - Each event provides a snapshot of the entire quote application at the time of the event, making it easier to audit changes.

---

### **Trade-Offs of Storing Complete Data**

1. **Larger Payloads**:
   - The event payloads become larger, increasing storage and network overhead.
   - This can become a concern in high-throughput systems or when storing a large number of events.

2. **Redundant Data**:
   - Unchanged fields are included in the payload, which may feel redundant.
   - For example, if only the email address is updated, the rest of the data (e.g., dependent details, employment details) is duplicated in the event.

3. **Increased Complexity in Event Producers**:
   - The event producer (e.g., the frontend or backend service) must gather all the data captured so far and include it in the event payload.
   - This adds complexity to the event producer logic.

4. **Potential for Inconsistencies**:
   - If the event producer fails to include the latest data from all pages, the event payload may become inconsistent with the actual state of the quote application.

---

### **When Does This Approach Make Sense?**

Storing complete data in each event makes sense in the following scenarios:

1. **Small to Medium-Sized Payloads**:
   - If the total data captured across all pages is relatively small, the overhead of storing complete data is manageable.

2. **Simpler Event Consumers**:
   - If you want to simplify the event consumer logic and avoid additional lookups or state reconstruction.

3. **Auditability and Debugging**:
   - If you need a complete snapshot of the quote application in each event for auditing or debugging purposes.

4. **Low Frequency of Updates**:
   - If updates to the quote application are infrequent, the overhead of larger payloads is less of a concern.

---

### **Alternative Approach: Store Only Changed Data with Lookups**

If storing complete data in each event is not feasible due to payload size or other constraints, you can use an alternative approach:

1. **Store Only Changed Data**:
   - Each event includes only the data that was changed (e.g., the updated email address).

2. **Event Consumer Performs Lookups**:
   - The event consumer fetches the current state of the quote application from the domain data store and applies the changes from the event.

#### **Example: PersonalDetailsSaved Event**
- The user updates the email address on the Personal Details page.
- The event payload includes only the updated email address.

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-005",
  "eventType": "PersonalDetailsSaved",
  "aggregateId": "quote-123",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:40:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "email": "john.doe.new@example.com"
  }
}
```

#### **Pros**:
- Smaller payloads.
- No redundant data.

#### **Cons**:
- Event consumer must perform additional lookups to fetch the current state.
- Increased complexity in the event consumer logic.

### **Recommendation**

If **simplicity for event consumers** and **self-contained events** are your top priorities, **storing complete data in each event** is a good choice. However, if **payload size** or **redundant data** is a concern, you can consider **storing only changed data** and having the event consumer perform lookups.

#### **Hybrid Approach**:
- For small to medium-sized payloads, store complete data in each event.
- For large payloads, store only changed data and provide a mechanism for the event consumer to fetch the current state.

### **Example Workflow with Complete Data**

1. **Initial Submission of Personal Details**:
   - Emit `PersonalDetailsSaved` with complete data.

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-001",
  "eventType": "PersonalDetailsSaved",
  "aggregateId": "quote-123",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:34:56Z",
  "payload": {
    "personalDetails": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "phone": "555-1234",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **User Updates Email Address**:
   - Emit `PersonalDetailsSaved` with complete data (including previously submitted pages).

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-005",
  "eventType": "PersonalDetailsSaved",
  "aggregateId": "quote-123",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:40:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "personalDetails": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "address": "123 Main St",
      "phone": "555-1234",
      "email": "john.doe.new@example.com"
    },
    "dependentDetails": {
      "dependents": [
        { "name": "Jane Doe", "relationship": "Spouse" },
        { "name": "Baby Doe", "relationship": "Child" }
      ]
    },
    "employmentDetails": {
      "employer": "Acme Corp",
      "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
      "income": 100000
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Event Consumer Updates Read Model**:
   - The event consumer updates the read model in the domain data store using the complete data from the event.

### **Conclusion**

Storing **complete data in each event** simplifies the event consumer's job and eliminates the need for additional lookups or state reconstruction. However, it comes with trade-offs such as larger payloads and redundant data. If these trade-offs are acceptable in your system, this approach is a good choice. Otherwise, consider a hybrid approach or storing only changed data with lookups.
