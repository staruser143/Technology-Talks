When designing an event sourcing system using Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API, you have several options for propagating changes from the event store to the read model. Each approach has its pros and cons, and the right choice depends on your specific requirements, such as scalability, latency, complexity, and cost. Below is a detailed comparison of the three approaches you mentioned:

---

### 1. **Change Data Capture (CDC)**
   - **How it works**: Use Cosmos DB's CDC feature to detect changes in the event store and trigger event processors to update the read model.
   - **Pros**:
     - **Real-time updates**: CDC provides near real-time change notifications, ensuring low latency for read model updates.
     - **Simplicity**: Directly tied to the database, so no additional infrastructure is required for change detection.
     - **Consistency**: Ensures that all changes to the event store are captured and processed.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Tight coupling**: The read model updates are tightly coupled to the event store, which can make the system less flexible.
     - **Scalability**: CDC may not scale well for very high-throughput systems, as it relies on the database's change feed mechanism.
     - **Complexity in processing**: You need to build and manage event processors to handle the change feed and update the read model.

   **Best for**: Systems where low latency and simplicity are critical, and the event store is not expected to handle extremely high throughput.

### 2. **Azure Event Grid**
   - **How it works**: Use Event Grid to notify subscribers (event processors) of changes in the event store. The subscribers then update the read model.
   - **Pros**:
     - **Decoupling**: Event Grid decouples the event store from the read model, making the system more modular and flexible.
     - **Scalability**: Event Grid is designed to handle high-throughput scenarios and can scale automatically.
     - **Integration**: Easily integrates with other Azure services and supports custom event handlers.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Latency**: Event Grid introduces some additional latency compared to CDC, as it involves an external service.
     - **Cost**: Event Grid adds an additional cost to the system, especially for high-volume event streams.
     - **Complexity**: Requires setting up and managing Event Grid topics and subscriptions.

   **Best for**: Systems that require high scalability, decoupling, and integration with other Azure services.

### 3. **Azure Event Hubs**
   - **How it works**: Use Event Hubs to publish events from the event store. Event Hub consumers listen for these events and update the read model.
   - **Pros**:
     - **High throughput**: Event Hubs is designed for high-throughput scenarios and can handle millions of events per second.
     - **Durability**: Events are stored durably in Event Hubs, ensuring no data loss.
     - **Flexibility**: Supports multiple consumers, enabling fan-out scenarios where multiple read models can be updated independently.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Complexity**: Requires setting up and managing Event Hubs, as well as building consumers to process events.
     - **Latency**: Slightly higher latency compared to CDC due to the additional hop through Event Hubs.
     - **Cost**: Event Hubs can be expensive for high-volume event streams.

   **Best for**: Systems with extremely high throughput requirements or those that need to support multiple consumers for the same event stream.

### **Key Considerations for Decision-Making**
1. **Latency**:
   - If low latency is critical, CDC is the best choice.
   - Event Grid and Event Hubs introduce additional latency but are still suitable for near real-time systems.

2. **Scalability**:
   - For high-throughput systems, Event Hubs is the most scalable option.
   - Event Grid is also scalable but may not match the throughput of Event Hubs.
   - CDC may struggle with very high throughput.

3. **Decoupling**:
   - Event Grid and Event Hubs provide better decoupling between the event store and the read model, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.

4. **Cost**:
   - CDC is typically the most cost-effective, as it leverages the database's built-in capabilities.
   - Event Grid and Event Hubs add additional costs, especially for high-volume systems.

5. **Complexity**:
   - CDC is simpler to implement but tightly couples the read model to the event store.
   - Event Grid and Event Hubs require more setup and management but offer greater flexibility and scalability.

### **Recommendation**
- **Use CDC** if you prioritize simplicity, low latency, and cost-effectiveness, and your system does not require extremely high throughput.
- **Use Event Grid** if you need scalability, decoupling, and integration with other Azure services, and can tolerate slightly higher latency and cost.
- **Use Event Hubs** if you have extremely high throughput requirements, need durable event storage, or want to support multiple consumers for the same event stream.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your specific use case, performance requirements, and budget constraints. You can also consider a hybrid approach, such as using CDC for low-latency updates and Event Hubs for high-throughput scenarios.
