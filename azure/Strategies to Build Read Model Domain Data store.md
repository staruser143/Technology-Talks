You're asking about different ways to propagate changes from your event store (Cosmos DB MongoDB API) to your read model store in an event sourcing architecture. Let's analyze the options:
1. Change Data Capture (CDC) with Event Projections:
 * How it works: Cosmos DB's change feed (CDC) captures changes in your event store. You process these changes to create event projections, which are then used to update your read model.
 * Pros:
   * Direct Integration: Tightly coupled with the database, potentially offering lower latency.
   * Ordered Delivery: CDC guarantees the order of events, which is crucial for maintaining read model consistency.
   * Potentially Simpler: If your projections are relatively straightforward, this approach can be conceptually simpler than introducing a separate messaging component.
 * Cons:
   * Vendor Lock-in: You're tied to Cosmos DB's CDC feature.
   * Complexity for Complex Projections:  If your read models require complex transformations or aggregations, the projection logic within your CDC processor can become complex and difficult to manage.
   * Scaling Challenges: Scaling the CDC processor itself can be a concern, especially with high event volumes.
   * Read Model Store Updates: You are directly updating the read model store from the change processor, which makes it tightly coupled and can impact the read model store performance if not designed carefully.
2. Azure Event Grid:
 * How it works: When a change occurs in your Cosmos DB event store, you publish an event to Event Grid. Subscribers (your event processors) listen to Event Grid for these events and update the read model.
 * Pros:
   * Decoupling: Event Grid decouples your event store from your read model updates. This improves flexibility and resilience.
   * Serverless: Event Grid is serverless, so you don't manage infrastructure.
   * Scalability: Event Grid scales automatically.
   * Filtering: Event Grid's filtering capabilities allow subscribers to receive only relevant events.
 * Cons:
   * Additional Component: Introduces another component (Event Grid) into your architecture.
   * Eventual Consistency: Event Grid provides eventual consistency, which might not be suitable for all use cases.
   * Complexity: Requires setting up Event Grid topics, subscriptions, and handling potential message delivery failures.
   * Event Size Limits: Event Grid has limits on event sizes, which can be a constraint depending on the size of your events.
3. Azure Event Hubs:
 * How it works: Similar to Event Grid, you publish events to Event Hubs when changes occur in your event store. Consumers (your event processors) listen to Event Hubs and update the read model.
 * Pros:
   * High Throughput: Event Hubs is designed for high-volume event streams.
   * Scalability: Event Hubs scales well.
   * Ordered Delivery (within partitions): Event Hubs guarantees ordered delivery of events within a partition.
   * Retention: Event Hubs can retain events for a specified period, allowing for reprocessing if needed.
 * Cons:
   * Additional Component: Introduces another component (Event Hubs) into your architecture.
   * Complexity: Requires more configuration than Event Grid, including partitioning and consumer groups.
   * Cost: Event Hubs can be more expensive than Event Grid, especially for lower event volumes.
Decision-Making:
Here's a breakdown to help you decide:
 * Event Volume and Velocity:
   * High Volume/Velocity: Event Hubs is the best choice.
   * Moderate Volume: Event Grid or CDC can work.
   * Low Volume: CDC or Event Grid are suitable.
 * Consistency Requirements:
   * Strong Consistency: CDC offers the closest to strong consistency.
   * Eventual Consistency: Event Grid and Event Hubs provide eventual consistency.
 * Complexity of Projections:
   * Simple Projections: CDC might be sufficient.
   * Complex Projections: Event Grid or Event Hubs offer better decoupling and allow you to manage projection logic separately.
 * Decoupling Needs:
   * High Decoupling: Event Grid or Event Hubs are the best options.
   * Lower Decoupling: CDC might be acceptable.
 * Cost Considerations:
   * Cost-Sensitive: Event Grid is typically the most cost-effective for moderate volumes. CDC costs are tied to your database usage.
   * Performance Intensive: Event Hubs might be more expensive but delivers better performance when required
 * Operational Complexity:
   * Simpler Operations: CDC might seem simpler initially, but complex projections can increase operational burden.
   * More Operations: Event Grid and Event Hubs add operational overhead but offer greater flexibility.
 * Vendor Lock-in:
   * Less Lock-in: Event Grid and Event Hubs reduce vendor lock-in compared to CDC.
Recommendation:
 * For most event sourcing scenarios with Cosmos DB, Event Hubs or Event Grid are generally preferred over CDC. They provide better decoupling, scalability, and flexibility.
 * If you have extremely high event volumes and require ordered delivery within partitions, Event Hubs is the better choice.
 * If your event volume is moderate and you prioritize ease of use and serverless operations, Event Grid is a good option.
 * Avoid CDC unless your projections are extremely simple, your event volume is low, and you're comfortable with vendor lock-in.  The tight coupling with the database can create performance and scaling challenges.
Remember to prototype and benchmark your chosen approach to ensure it meets your specific performance and scalability requirements.  Consider the long-term maintainability and evolution of your system when making your decision.
