Great question! When using **Kafka Connect** to stream data from **MongoDB collections** to **Kafka topics**, you have flexibility in how you structure the data flow. Here's a breakdown of your options and considerations:

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Separate Kafka Topics for Each Collection**
This is the **recommended approach** in most event-driven architectures.

- **quote_events ‚Üí quote-events-topic**
- **quote_profile ‚Üí quote-profile-topic**

#### Benefits:
- **Decoupling**: Each topic represents a distinct domain concept.
- **Scalability**: Consumers can scale independently.
- **Filtering**: Easier to apply filters or transformations specific to each data type.
- **Schema Evolution**: Each topic can evolve independently without breaking consumers.

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: Single Kafka Topic for Both Collections**
This is **possible**, but comes with trade-offs.

#### How it works:
- You configure Kafka Connect to stream both collections into the same topic.
- You must include a **field or metadata** to distinguish between event types (e.g., `"source": "quote_event"` vs `"source": "quote_profile"`).

#### Challenges:
- **Schema Complexity**: Consumers must handle multiple schemas.
- **Filtering Overhead**: Consumers need logic to differentiate and process records.
- **Error-Prone**: Easier to introduce bugs if schemas are not well managed.

---

### üîß Kafka Connect Setup
To stream from MongoDB, you typically use the **MongoDB Kafka Connector**. You can configure it like this:

#### For Separate Topics:
```json
{
  "name": "mongo-quote-events-connector",
  "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
  "tasks.max": "1",
  "topic.prefix": "quote-events-topic",
  "connection.uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
  "database": "quotes_db",
  "collection": "quote_events"
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "mongo-quote-profile-connector",
  "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
  "tasks.max": "1",
  "topic.prefix": "quote-profile-topic",
  "connection.uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
  "database": "quotes_db",
  "collection": "quote_profile"
}
```

#### For Single Topic:
You‚Äôd need to use a **Single Message Transform (SMT)** to route both collections to the same topic and add metadata.

---

### üß† Recommendation
Use **separate Kafka topics** for `quote_events` and `quote_profile`. This aligns better with **event-driven best practices**, simplifies consumer logic, and improves maintainability.


You're thinking along the right lines‚Äîrevisiting the **data modeling** in MongoDB can help simplify your Kafka architecture. Let's explore whether merging the two collections makes sense, and what trade-offs are involved.

---

### üîç Purpose of Each Collection

1. **`quote_events`**:
   - Captures **event-driven changes** related to a quote (e.g., created, updated, approved).
   - Typically **append-only**, time-series style.
   - Used to **track history** or trigger downstream actions.

2. **`quote_profile`**:
   - Stores **static or slowly changing** profile data of the person creating the quote.
   - More like a **reference or lookup** table.
   - Not inherently event-driven unless profile changes are tracked as events.

---

### üß© Can They Be Merged?

You **could** merge them if:

- Every event in `quote_events` includes the relevant profile data.
- You treat profile updates as events too (i.e., profile changes become part of the event stream).
- You‚Äôre okay with **denormalization** (i.e., duplicating profile data across events).

#### Example of a unified document:
```json
{
  "event_type": "quote_created",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-14T10:00:00Z",
  "quote_id": "Q12345",
  "profile": {
    "user_id": "U67890",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  },
  "quote_details": {
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Merging
- **Single Kafka topic** simplifies infrastructure.
- Easier to consume and build read models.
- Reduces need for joins or lookups downstream.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs
- **Data duplication**: Profile info repeated across events.
- **Stale data risk**: If profile changes, older events retain outdated info.
- **Loss of separation of concerns**: Mixing event and reference data can blur boundaries.

---

### üß† Recommendation

If your system is **event-centric**, consider treating profile updates as events and merge into a single collection. Otherwise, keep them separate and use **two Kafka Connectors** with **Single Message Transforms (SMTs)** to enrich or route data as needed.

Would you like help designing a unified schema or setting up SMTs to enrich events with profile data dynamically?

Query:

How do I handle the scenario, when a person has a profile and creates 2 different quotes. If at a later stage, he makes some changes to his profile and at the same creates a new quote. Should the profile data in earlier 2 quotes also be changed accordingly, or should they reflect the fact that it was data at that point of time and should not be updated when profile is updated during the 3rd quote creation.


This is a crucial design decision in event-driven systems and touches on the concept of **temporal consistency** and **data immutability**. Let's break it down:

---

### üß≠ Guiding Principle: Events Should Reflect the State at the Time They Occurred

In most event-driven architectures, especially those following **Event Sourcing** or **CQRS**, the idea is that:

- **Events are immutable**: They represent what happened at a specific point in time.
- **Historical accuracy matters**: You want to preserve the context in which an event occurred.

---

### üîÑ Scenario Breakdown

1. **User creates Quote A and Quote B** with profile data `P1`.
2. Later, the user **updates profile to P2** and creates **Quote C**.

#### Should Quotes A and B reflect P2?
**No**, unless there's a business requirement to retroactively update historical data.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Approach

- **Embed profile snapshot** in each quote event:
  - When Quote A is created, embed profile data `P1`.
  - When Quote C is created, embed profile data `P2`.

This way:
- You preserve the **state of the profile at the time of each quote**.
- You avoid unintended side effects from profile updates.

---

### üß† Alternative: Reference Profile by ID Only

If you want to avoid duplication:
- Store only `user_id` in quote events.
- Use a **read model or view** to join with the latest profile data when needed.

But this means:
- You lose historical context unless you version or timestamp profile changes.

---

### üß© Hybrid Strategy (Best of Both Worlds)

- Store `user_id` **and** a **snapshot of profile data** in each quote event.
- This gives you:
  - Historical accuracy.
  - Ability to enrich or reprocess events later if needed.

---

Would you like help designing a schema for this hybrid approach or setting up Kafka Connect to enrich quote events with profile snapshots at ingestion time?

Absolutely! Here's a schema design that supports your hybrid strategy‚Äîcapturing both a **reference to the user profile** and a **snapshot of the profile data** at the time of quote creation.

---

### üìò MongoDB Schema Design

#### 1. **quote_events Collection**
Each document represents a quote-related event, enriched with a snapshot of the user's profile.

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "event_type": "quote_created",  // or "quote_updated", etc.
  "timestamp": ISODate("2025-07-14T10:00:00Z"),
  "quote_id": "Q12345",
  "user_id": "U67890",  // Reference to the user
  "profile_snapshot": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "phone": "+91-9876543210",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "location": "Chennai, India"
  },
  "quote_details": {
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "INR",
    "product": "Insurance",
    "valid_until": ISODate("2025-08-14T00:00:00Z")
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "web_portal",
    "created_by": "Jane Doe",
    "version": 1
  }
}
```

---

#### 2. **quote_profile Collection**
Stores the latest profile data for each user. This is the source of truth for profile updates.

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "user_id": "U67890",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "phone": "+91-9876543210",
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "location": "Chennai, India",
  "last_updated": ISODate("2025-07-14T09:55:00Z")
}
```

---

### üß† Design Notes

- **Immutability**: `quote_events` are immutable and preserve the profile snapshot at the time of the event.
- **Up-to-date Reference**: `quote_profile` can be updated independently and used for current views or analytics.
- **Versioning**: You can add a `profile_version` field if you want to track changes over time.

---

### üîÑ Kafka Connect Strategy

- Use **MongoDB Source Connector** to stream `quote_events` to Kafka.
- Optionally use **Kafka SMT (Single Message Transform)** to enrich events with profile data at ingestion time if not already embedded.

---

Do we need to use Kafka SMT along with MongoDB Source Connector for this scenario 

Great question! Whether you **need** to use **Kafka Single Message Transforms (SMTs)** along with the **MongoDB Source Connector** depends on **how and where** you're enriching the `quote_events` with profile data.

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Profile Snapshot Already Embedded in `quote_events`
If your application logic **already enriches the event** with the profile snapshot **before writing to MongoDB**, then:

- **Kafka SMT is not needed**.
- The MongoDB Source Connector will simply stream the enriched document to Kafka as-is.

---

### ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Profile Data Is Stored Separately in `quote_profile`
If your `quote_events` only contain a `user_id`, and you want to **enrich the event with profile data at ingestion time**, then:

- **Kafka SMT is useful**.
- You can use SMTs to:
  - **Join** with another source (e.g., `quote_profile`).
  - **Add metadata**, transform fields, or route messages.

However, **Kafka SMTs do not support joins across collections or databases out of the box**. For complex enrichment like joining `quote_events` with `quote_profile`, you'd typically need:

- A **custom SMT plugin**, or
- A **Kafka Streams** or **KSQL** pipeline to perform the join after ingestion.

---

### üß† Recommended Strategy

If you want to keep things simple and avoid custom Kafka logic:

- Enrich the `quote_events` with profile snapshot **before writing to MongoDB**.
- Use the **MongoDB Source Connector without SMTs**.
- This ensures the event is complete and immutable at the source.
