# Database Selection Guidance for Event-Driven System on AKS

When choosing between Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and MongoDB Atlas for your event-sourced, DDD-based system running on AKS, here are key considerations:

## Event Store Requirements

For the event store (which has different needs than the domain data store):

**Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL advantages:**
- Native change feed provides excellent event streaming capabilities
- Guaranteed low latency at any scale (SLA-backed)
- Multi-region distribution with strong consistency options
- Serverless capacity mode can be cost-effective for event streaming
- Tight integration with Azure Functions for event processing

**MongoDB Atlas advantages:**
- Change streams API provides similar functionality to Cosmos change feed
- More flexible schema evolution (important for long-lived event stores)
- Potentially lower cost for very high-volume append-only workloads
- More mature aggregation framework for complex event projections

## Domain Data Store Requirements

For the domain data (read models, aggregates):

**Azure Cosmos DB advantages:**
- Automatic indexing works well for most query patterns
- Strong consistency when needed for domain transactions
- Integrated with Azure ecosystem (monitoring, backups, etc.)
- Better performance for point reads (important for aggregate roots)

**MongoDB Atlas advantages:**
- Richer query language (especially for complex domain models)
- More flexible indexing options
- Potentially better tooling for data exploration
- Transactions across documents work well for DDD aggregates

## Hybrid Approach Consideration

You might consider using:
- Cosmos DB for the event store (leveraging change feed)
- MongoDB Atlas for domain data (richer query capabilities)

## Decision Factors

1. **Azure Integration**: If deeply invested in Azure, Cosmos DB offers tighter integration
2. **Consistency Needs**: Cosmos offers more granular consistency controls
3. **Query Complexity**: MongoDB's query language is more expressive
4. **Team Skills**: Existing MongoDB expertise might favor Atlas
5. **Global Distribution**: Both support it, but Cosmos has more turnkey options
6. **Cost Structure**: Analyze your specific workload patterns for each

## Recommendation

For a greenfield project on AKS, I'd lean toward:
- **Azure Cosmos DB** if you value Azure-native integration and predictable performance
- **MongoDB Atlas** if you need maximum query flexibility or have existing MongoDB expertise

Both are excellent choices, and the decision might come down to specific workload patterns and team preferences rather than technical limitations.


Yes, a hybrid approach using **Azure Cosmos DB for the event store** and **MongoDB Atlas for the domain store (read models/aggregates)** can be an excellent architectural choice for your event-sourced system. Here's why this makes sense and what to consider:

---

### **Benefits of the Hybrid Approach**

1. **Optimized Event Store with Cosmos DB**
   - **Change Feed** is perfect for event sourcing (append-only writes with real-time streaming)
   - **Low-latency guaranteed writes** (critical for event ordering)
   - **Strong consistency** when needed (e.g., for event versioning/idempotency checks)
   - **Serverless tier** works well for bursty event ingestion

2. **MongoDB Atlas for Domain Data & Aggregations**
   - **Rich querying & aggregation framework** (better for complex read models)
   - **Flexible schema evolution** (useful for evolving domain models)
   - **Multi-document transactions** (helpful for consistency in DDD aggregates)
   - **Better tooling** for ad-hoc queries and analytics

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Event store remains simple (append-only, high throughput)
   - Domain store optimizes for query flexibility and business logic

---

### **When This Hybrid Approach Shines**
✔ **Event-sourcing with CQRS** (Cosmos for writes, MongoDB for reads)  
✔ **Complex domain models** requiring advanced querying (joins, nested filters, etc.)  
✔ **Need for real-time projections** (Cosmos Change Feed → Azure Functions → MongoDB)  
✔ **Mixed consistency requirements** (strong for events, eventual for some read models)  

---

### **Challenges to Address**
1. **Operational Complexity**  
   - Managing two database technologies (monitoring, backups, security)  
   - Need for a **resilient projection engine** (to keep MongoDB in sync)  

2. **Cost**  
   - Both services can get expensive at scale (Cosmos RU/s, MongoDB Atlas compute)  

3. **Latency in Projections**  
   - Eventual consistency between event store and domain store  

---

### **Implementation Suggestions**
1. **Projection Layer**  
   - Use **Azure Functions** (Cosmos DB Trigger) to process the Change Feed and update MongoDB  
   - Or deploy a **dedicated projection service** in AKS (using Kafka/Event Hubs as a buffer)  

2. **Optimize Cosmos for Events**  
   - Partition key = `AggregateId` (for efficient event loading per aggregate)  
   - Disable unnecessary indexing (events are often queried in order by `AggregateId` + `Version`)  

3. **Optimize MongoDB for Queries**  
   - Design collections/indices around **read patterns** (not domain objects)  
   - Use materialized views for expensive aggregations  

---

### **Alternatives to Consider**
- **Pure Cosmos DB**: If your query needs are simple (or you can use Azure Synapse for analytics)  
- **Pure MongoDB Atlas**: If you want to simplify ops and can tolerate its event store limitations  

---

### **Final Verdict**
**Yes, the hybrid approach makes sense** if:  
- You need **high-performance event ingestion** (Cosmos excels here)  
- Your **domain model requires complex queries** (MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline is superior)  
- You can **manage the operational overhead** of two systems  

This is a **production-proven pattern** used by many event-sourced systems on Azure. Just ensure you design a robust projection system to keep MongoDB in sync.

If you choose **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** for both your **event store** and **domain store**, you still have several powerful options for **aggregation capabilities** in Azure. While Cosmos DB's SQL-like query language is less expressive than MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline, you can combine it with other Azure services to achieve similar functionality.

---

## **1. Built-in Cosmos DB Aggregation Features**
### **Basic Aggregations (Using SQL API)**
Cosmos DB supports standard SQL aggregations:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(1) as eventCount,
    AVG(e.value) as averageValue,
    SUM(e.value) as totalValue,
    MIN(e.timestamp) as firstEvent,
    MAX(e.timestamp) as lastEvent
FROM events e
WHERE e.aggregateId = "123"
```
- Works well for **simple aggregations** (counts, sums, averages).
- Limited compared to MongoDB’s `$group`, `$lookup`, and pipeline stages.

### **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**
For more complex logic, you can write JavaScript UDFs:
```sql
SELECT udf.calculateBusinessMetric(e) FROM e
```
- Useful for **custom calculations**, but can hurt performance at scale.

### **Stored Procedures**
- Execute complex transactional logic in JavaScript.
- Useful for **maintaining derived aggregates** (e.g., keeping a `totalOrders` counter).

## **2. Change Feed + Azure Functions (For Real-Time Aggregations)**
Since you’re using event sourcing, you can **compute aggregates in real-time**:
1. **Cosmos DB Change Feed** streams new events.
2. **Azure Functions (Cosmos DB Trigger)** processes each event.
3. **Update materialized views** in another Cosmos container.

**Example: Maintaining a `CustomerOrderSummary`**
```csharp
[FunctionName("UpdateOrderSummary")]
public static async Task Run(
    [CosmosDBTrigger(
        databaseName: "events",
        containerName: "orders",
        ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
        LeaseContainerName = "leases")]
    IReadOnlyList<Document> events,
    [CosmosDB(
        databaseName: "domain",
        collectionName: "customerSummaries",
        ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection")]
    IAsyncCollector<Document> summaries,
    ILogger log)
{
    foreach (var e in events)
    {
        var customerId = e.GetPropertyValue<string>("customerId");
        var amount = e.GetPropertyValue<decimal>("amount");
        
        // Fetch existing summary (or create new)
        var summary = await GetOrCreateSummary(summaries, customerId);
        
        // Update aggregate
        summary.TotalOrders++;
        summary.TotalAmount += amount;
        
        // Save back
        await summaries.AddAsync(summary);
    }
}
```
✔ **Pros:** Real-time, scalable, serverless.  
❌ **Cons:** Requires careful error handling (idempotency, retries).  

---

## **3. Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB (Analytics)**
If you need **complex aggregations over large datasets**:
1. **Enable Synapse Link** (HTAP—Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing).
2. **Query with Spark SQL or T-SQL** (without impacting operational workload).

**Example (Spark SQL):**
```sql
SELECT 
    customerId, 
    COUNT(*) as orderCount, 
    SUM(amount) as lifetimeValue
FROM cosmos.analytics.events
GROUP BY customerId
```
✔ **Pros:**  
- No ETL needed.  
- Supports **JOINs, window functions, ML**.  
- Doesn’t consume RU/s (separate analytical store).  

❌ **Cons:**  
- Near real-time (~2-5 min latency).  
- Additional cost for Synapse.  

---

## **4. Materialized Views in Cosmos DB**
- Use **another Cosmos container** to store precomputed aggregates.
- Updated via **Change Feed Processor** or **Azure Functions**.

**Example Schema:**
```json
{
    "customerId": "123",
    "totalOrders": 42,
    "lastOrderDate": "2024-03-20",
    "metrics": {
        "monthlySpend": 1500.00
    }
}
```
✔ **Pros:** Fast reads, no runtime computation.  
❌ **Cons:** Requires eventual consistency.  

---

## **5. Azure Data Explorer (ADX) for Advanced Analytics**
If you need **time-series aggregations, anomaly detection, or AI-driven insights**:
1. **Stream events to ADX** (Kusto DB).
2. **Run high-performance aggregations** with KQL.

**Example (KQL):**
```kusto
Events
| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| summarize Total=sum(Value) by CustomerId, bin(Timestamp, 1d)
| render timechart
```
✔ **Pros:**  
- Extremely fast for time-series data.  
- Supports **machine learning** (`series_decompose_anomalies`).  

❌ **Cons:**  
- Another service to manage.  
- Best for analytics (not transactional queries).  

---

## **Recommendation**
| Use Case | Best Option |
|----------|-------------|
| **Simple aggregations** (count, sum, avg) | Built-in SQL API |
| **Real-time projections** (CQRS) | Change Feed + Azure Functions |
| **Complex analytics** (JOINs, ML) | Synapse Link |
| **Time-series/trend analysis** | Azure Data Explorer |
| **Precomputed aggregates** | Materialized Views |

### **Final Verdict**
- **If your aggregations are simple** → Stick with Cosmos SQL API.  
- **If you need real-time projections** → Use Change Feed + Functions.  
- **If you need advanced analytics** → Add Synapse Link or ADX.  

Cosmos DB can handle both **event sourcing** and **domain data** effectively, especially when paired with Azure’s serverless ecosystem. The key is **decoupling writes (events) from reads (aggregates)** using the Change Feed.
