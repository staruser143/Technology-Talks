Here’s a **comparison table** between **Logic Apps Consumption (multi-tenant)** and **Logic Apps Standard (single-tenant)**, focusing on **isolation, security, performance, and cost trade-offs**:

### ✅ **Consumption vs. Standard (Single-Tenant) Comparison**

| Feature / Aspect           | **Consumption (Multi-Tenant)**                          | **Standard (Single-Tenant)**                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation**            | Shared infrastructure (multi-tenant)                   | Dedicated compute (single-tenant)                        |
| **Network Security**      | No VNET integration; public endpoints only             | Full VNET integration, private endpoints, IP restrictions |
| **Performance**           | Shared resources → possible noisy-neighbor impact      | Predictable performance; can scale up/down               |
| **Scaling**               | Auto-scale per execution                               | Manual or auto-scale via App Service Plan                |
| **Workflow Types**        | **Stateful only**                                      | **Stateful and Stateless**                               |
| **Built-in Connectors**   | Limited (mostly managed connectors)                    | Built-in connectors for high throughput, lower latency   |
| **Local Development**     | Not supported                                          | Supported (VS Code, containerized runtime)              |
| **Cost Model**            | Pay-per-execution (ideal for low/medium volume)        | Fixed App Service Plan cost (better for high volume)     |
| **Compliance & Governance** | Basic isolation                                       | Strong isolation for regulated industries (finance, healthcare) |
| **Run History Retention** | Limited by default                                     | Configurable retention                                   |

### ✅ **When to prefer single-tenant (Standard):**
- You need **VNET integration**, **private endpoints**, or **IP restrictions**.
- You require **predictable performance** and **dedicated resources**.
- You want **local development**, **containerized deployment**, or **custom runtime tuning**.
- You need **stateless workflows** for high-throughput, low-latency APIs.
- You operate in **regulated industries** where isolation and compliance are critical.
