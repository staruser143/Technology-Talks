Great question! **Single-tenant isolation** (as in Logic Apps Standard) is preferred in scenarios where you need more control, security, and performance guarantees than the multi-tenant Consumption model can provide. Here are the main reasons:

---

### ✅ **Why choose single-tenant isolation?**

1. **Network Security & Compliance**
   - You can integrate with **Azure Virtual Network (VNET)**, use **private endpoints**, and restrict inbound/outbound traffic.
   - Essential for industries with strict compliance (finance, healthcare, government).

2. **Dedicated Resources**
   - Your workflows run on **dedicated compute** instead of sharing resources with other tenants.
   - This reduces noisy-neighbor issues and gives more predictable performance.

3. **Custom Scaling & Performance**
   - You can **scale up/down** the underlying App Service Plan or run in **App Service Environment (ASE)** for high throughput.
   - Useful for heavy workloads or when you need to guarantee SLAs.

4. **Local Development & Portability**
   - Logic Apps Standard supports **local debugging in VS Code** and **containerized deployments**.
   - Great for CI/CD pipelines and hybrid scenarios.

5. **Advanced Features**
   - **Built-in connectors** (faster than managed connectors in Consumption).
   - **Multiple workflows in one app** (stateful and stateless mixed).
   - **Custom runtime tuning** (timeouts, concurrency, retention).

### ✅ When is multi-tenant (Consumption) enough?
- If you only need **pay-per-execution**, **don’t require VNET**, and **don’t need strict isolation**, Consumption is simpler and cheaper.

Would you like me to **create a quick comparison table** between **multi-tenant (Consumption)** and **single-tenant (Standard)** focusing on **security, performance, and cost trade-offs**? Or should I **draw a decision diagram** for when to pick each?
