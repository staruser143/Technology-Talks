Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API offers five consistency levels, each balancing trade-offs between data consistency, availability, and latency. Here’s a detailed explanation of each level and when to use them:


---

1. Strong Consistency

Behavior:

Guarantees linearizability (the most stringent consistency level).

Reads always return the latest committed write.


Use Cases:

Financial systems where strict ordering and the latest state are critical (e.g., bank account transactions).

Inventory systems needing up-to-date stock information.

Event sourcing scenarios where event ordering is paramount.


Trade-Off:

Higher read latency and lower availability across multiple regions due to synchronization overhead.



---

2. Bounded Staleness Consistency

Behavior:

Guarantees that reads lag behind writes by a defined time window or a specific number of operations.

Ensures global ordering of operations.


Use Cases:

Social media timelines that tolerate slight delays but require ordered posts.

Analytics systems that can accept slightly stale data for reporting purposes.

Distributed applications with controlled staleness requirements.


Trade-Off:

Slightly better availability than strong consistency while maintaining order guarantees.



---

3. Session Consistency (Default)

Behavior:

Guarantees consistency per client session.

Within a single session, reads reflect the latest write.


Use Cases:

E-commerce applications where user actions must reflect consistent cart operations.

Personalized user dashboards where data consistency is crucial per user session.

Collaborative applications where session-based views are acceptable.


Trade-Off:

Optimized for low latency and availability; works best for user-centric workloads.



---

4. Consistent Prefix Consistency

Behavior:

Guarantees that reads never see out-of-order writes but may see partially updated data.


Use Cases:

Event processing systems that require ordered events but can tolerate staleness.

IoT applications ingesting sensor data where ordering matters more than staleness.


Trade-Off:

Lower latency and higher availability than stronger consistency models.



---

5. Eventual Consistency

Behavior:

Offers no ordering or freshness guarantees.

Reads eventually converge to the latest state.


Use Cases:

Content delivery networks (CDNs) serving static content.

Applications handling non-critical metadata (e.g., user likes on social media).

Distributed cache scenarios where immediate consistency isn’t required.


Trade-Off:

Lowest latency and highest availability; suitable for large-scale, globally distributed systems.
