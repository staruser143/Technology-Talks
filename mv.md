When leveraging materialized views to support read models and user dashboards in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API, the consistency levels play a critical role in balancing data freshness, performance, and availability. Below is a detailed breakdown of how each consistency level impacts this scenario:


---

1. Strong Consistency

Impact:

Guarantees that the materialized views always reflect the latest updates from the event store.

Reads from user dashboards will always show up-to-date and accurate data.


Pros:

Ensures complete accuracy for user dashboards and critical reporting systems.


Cons:

Higher read latency and reduced availability in multi-region deployments.

Increased resource cost due to synchronization requirements.


Use Case:

Financial dashboards or critical systems requiring accurate real-time data (e.g., stock trading platforms).



---

2. Bounded Staleness Consistency

Impact:

Materialized views reflect updates that are slightly delayed by a defined time or number of operations.

Guarantees order but tolerates some staleness.


Pros:

Strong ordering guarantees with improved performance over Strong consistency.

Suitable for near-real-time dashboards.


Cons:

Delayed data updates may be visible on dashboards.


Use Case:

Analytical dashboards that can tolerate slight delays (e.g., sales dashboards updated within a few seconds).



---

3. Session Consistency (Recommended Default)

Impact:

Materialized views are consistent within the same user session.

Guarantees that each user sees consistent data for their session.


Pros:

Best trade-off between performance, consistency, and latency.

Ensures personalized dashboards remain accurate during a user session.


Cons:

Cross-session inconsistencies may occur if users compare views.


Use Case:

Personalized dashboards (e.g., e-commerce order tracking).

Multi-step workflows where data consistency matters within a single session.



---

4. Consistent Prefix Consistency

Impact:

Materialized views will reflect events in the correct order but may show partial updates.


Pros:

Ensures order of events without strict consistency overhead.

Improved performance for large-scale dashboards.


Cons:

Stale or incomplete data may appear temporarily on dashboards.


Use Case:

IoT dashboards or event-driven dashboards where eventual convergence is acceptable.



---

5. Eventual Consistency

Impact:

Materialized views may show inconsistent or outdated data until convergence.


Pros:

Lowest latency and highest availability.

Best performance for global-scale applications.


Cons:

No guarantee of freshness or ordering.

Dashboards may show stale or inaccurate data.


Use Case:

Non-critical dashboards (e.g., social media metrics).

Applications with non-time-sensitive data needs.
