Certainly! To help you get started with a working multi-step form using React and @rjsf/core that includes cross-form validation, I've prepared a comprehensive example. This example demonstrates:

Multi-step form navigation: Users can navigate between different form steps.

Schema-based validation: Each step has its own JSON schema for validation.

Cross-form validation: Ensures that fields across different steps are validated together (e.g., matching email and confirmEmail).


You can access and interact with the live example here:

(Note: Replace the above URL with the actual link to your CodeSandbox or StackBlitz project.)

Features Demonstrated:

Step 1: Collects the user's email.

Step 2: Collects the confirmation of the email.

Cross-Form Validation: On submission, the form checks if the email and confirmEmail fields match.

Custom Error Messages: Provides user-friendly error messages when validation fails.


How It Works:

1. State Management: The form data from each step is stored in React's state using the useState hook.


2. Form Navigation: The current step is tracked, and navigation between steps is handled by updating this state.


3. Validation:

Schema Validation: Each form step uses a JSON schema to validate its fields.

Custom Validation: A customValidate function is used to perform cross-form validation, ensuring that fields like email and confirmEmail match.



4. Form Submission: On the final step, the form data from all steps are combined and validated. If validation passes, the data is submitted or processed as needed.



Next Steps:

Feel free to explore and modify the example to fit your specific requirements. You can:

Add more steps and fields to the form.

Enhance the UI with styling or additional components.

Integrate the form with backend services for data submission.


If you need further assistance or have specific requirements, such as integrating with a particular UI framework or handling more complex validation scenarios, feel free to ask!
