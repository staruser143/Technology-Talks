Excellent — and very insightful question 👏

You’re **exactly right** to pause on the `relationshipMapping` part — it *does* make the YAML (and potentially the code) **too specific** to one use case (“primary / spouse / dependent”).
Let’s look deeper into what’s happening — and how we can make it truly **generic** so you never have to touch code for similar structures again.

---

## 🧩 Problem Recap

In your earlier YAML, you had something like:

```yaml
mappings:
  - source: applicantList[]
    groupBy: relationship
    relationshipMapping:
      Primary: primaryapplicant
      Spouse: spouse
      Child: dependents
    fields:
      - source: fname
        target: "{role}.fname.{index+1}"
```

Here:

* `groupBy: relationship` means “partition applicantList by the `relationship` field”.
* `relationshipMapping` is a *hardcoded lookup table* from actual JSON values (like “Primary”) to output field prefixes (“primaryapplicant”).

That’s convenient for one domain, but not scalable.

## ⚙️ What’s Wrong with `relationshipMapping`

1. It’s **domain-specific** — assumes you always have those same categories.
2. It **clutters YAML** with ad-hoc translation logic.
3. It **forces** the processor to understand the meaning of `"Primary"`, `"Spouse"`, etc., instead of handling them generically.
4. It prevents **reusability** — the next user might have `"owner"`, `"tenant"`, `"guarantor"` instead.

---

## ✅ Generic, Extensible Alternative

We can replace `relationshipMapping` with a **computed key template**, using the grouping value directly in the field mapping via placeholders.

### Example of Generic YAML

```yaml
mappings:
  - source: applicantList[]
    groupBy: relationship
    fields:
      - source: fname
        target: "{group}.fname.{index+1}"
      - source: lname
        target: "{group}.lname.{index+1}"
```

Here’s what happens:

* `groupBy: relationship` groups array elements by that field (e.g., `"Primary"`, `"Spouse"`, `"Child"`).
* `{group}` becomes a **placeholder** representing the current group value.
* If you want lowercase or formatted variants, we can support transforms like `{group|lower}` or `{group|snake}`.

### Result for Your JSON

If JSON looks like:

```json
{
  "applicantList": [
    { "relationship": "Primary", "fname": "John", "lname": "Doe" },
    { "relationship": "Spouse", "fname": "Jane", "lname": "Doe" },
    { "relationship": "Child", "fname": "Sara", "lname": "Doe" }
  ]
}
```

The output mapping dynamically expands to:

```
primary.fname.1 = John
primary.lname.1 = Doe
spouse.fname.1 = Jane
spouse.lname.1 = Doe
child.fname.1 = Sara
child.lname.1 = Doe
```

No hardcoded mapping table required ✅
No code changes needed ✅
Fully data-driven ✅

## 🧠 Implementation Sketch (for AcroFormProcessor)

The key part of the logic would look like this:

```java
if (groupBy != null) {
    Map<String, List<JsonNode>> grouped = StreamSupport.stream(arrayNode.spliterator(), false)
        .filter(JsonNode::isObject)
        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(node -> node.path(groupBy).asText()));

    for (Map.Entry<String, List<JsonNode>> entry : grouped.entrySet()) {
        String groupName = entry.getKey();
        List<JsonNode> groupItems = entry.getValue();

        for (int i = 0; i < groupItems.size(); i++) {
            JsonNode item = groupItems.get(i);
            int index = i + 1;
            for (FieldMapping f : mapping.getFields()) {
                JsonNode valNode = item.path(f.getSource());
                if (!valNode.isMissingNode()) {
                    String target = f.getTarget()
                        .replace("{group}", groupName.toLowerCase())
                        .replace("{index+1}", String.valueOf(index));
                    fieldValues.put(target, valNode.asText());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements for Flexibility

If you want *controlled normalization* of the group key:

```yaml
groupBy: relationship
groupTransform: lower
```

Then in code:

```java
String groupName = applyTransform(entry.getKey(), mapping.getGroupTransform());
```

with `applyTransform` handling `lower`, `upper`, `snake`, etc.
