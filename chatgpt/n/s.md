Your canvas now contains the complete **Option A (FlatMap) generic JSONata-based mapping engine** with *no domain references*. If you'd like:

* Part 3 (JSON schema + validations)
* Part 4 (Spring Boot wiring)
* Part 5 (unit tests)
* Example YAMLs
* Integration with PDF AcroForm generation
* Performance-optimized JSONata expression caching
* Freemarker/HTML template support (later)

Just tell me and I will proceed.
