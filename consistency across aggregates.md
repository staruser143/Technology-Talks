In the **Quoting scenario** of the insurance industry, the **"Consistency Across Aggregates"** problem can arise when changes to multiple aggregates (e.g., `Quote`, `Policy`, `Customer`) need to be consistent with each other. For example:
- When a **Quote** is approved, a **Policy** must be created, and the **Customer's** policy count must be updated.
- These operations involve multiple aggregates, and ensuring consistency across them is challenging in a distributed system.

Let’s break down the problem and how to address it:

---

### **1. Understanding the Problem**
In a distributed system:
- Aggregates are typically stored in different partitions or even different databases.
- Traditional **ACID transactions** (which guarantee atomicity across multiple entities) are not feasible across aggregates.
- If one operation fails (e.g., creating a Policy), the system must handle the inconsistency gracefully.

---

### **2. Strategies to Address Consistency Across Aggregates**

#### **a. Sagas (Orchestration or Choreography)**
A **Saga** is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates a single aggregate and publishes an event to trigger the next transaction. If any step fails, compensating actions are executed to undo the changes.

##### **How It Works**:
1. **Orchestration**:
   - A central orchestrator (e.g., a Saga Manager) coordinates the steps.
   - Example:
     - Step 1: Approve the Quote.
     - Step 2: Create the Policy.
     - Step 3: Update the Customer's policy count.
   - If any step fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating actions (e.g., cancel the Policy).

2. **Choreography**:
   - Each aggregate publishes events, and other aggregates react to those events.
   - Example:
     - The `Quote` aggregate publishes a `QuoteApproved` event.
     - The `Policy` aggregate listens to the event and creates a Policy.
     - The `Customer` aggregate listens to the event and updates the policy count.

##### **Example Workflow**:
1. **QuoteApproved Event**:
   ```json
   {
     "eventID": "event-1",
     "quoteID": "quote-123",
     "eventType": "QuoteApproved",
     "data": {
       "premium": 1200,
       "customerId": "cust-456"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **PolicyCreated Event**:
   ```json
   {
     "eventID": "event-2",
     "policyID": "policy-789",
     "eventType": "PolicyCreated",
     "data": {
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "customerId": "cust-456"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **CustomerPolicyCountUpdated Event**:
   ```json
   {
     "eventID": "event-3",
     "customerId": "cust-456",
     "eventType": "CustomerPolicyCountUpdated",
     "data": {
       "policyCount": 5
     }
   }
   ```

##### **Compensating Actions**:
- If the `PolicyCreated` step fails, the Saga might trigger a `QuoteRejected` event to undo the approval.

---

#### **b. Eventual Consistency with Idempotency**
In this approach, you accept eventual consistency and rely on **idempotency** to handle retries and failures.

##### **How It Works**:
1. Each aggregate processes events independently.
2. If an event fails, it is retried until it succeeds.
3. Idempotency ensures that processing the same event multiple times does not cause inconsistencies.

##### **Example**:
- The `QuoteApproved` event is processed by the `Policy` and `Customer` aggregates.
- If the `Policy` aggregate fails to process the event, it retries until it succeeds.

---

#### **c. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**
A **Two-Phase Commit** protocol ensures atomicity across multiple aggregates by coordinating a prepare phase and a commit phase. However, this approach is complex and not commonly used in distributed systems due to its overhead and scalability issues.

---

### **3. Choosing the Right Strategy**
For the **Quoting scenario**, **Sagas** (especially orchestration) are the most practical and scalable solution. Here’s why:
- Sagas allow you to break down the process into smaller, manageable steps.
- Compensating actions ensure that inconsistencies are resolved.
- Sagas work well with event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).

---

### **4. Implementing Sagas in the Quoting Scenario**

#### **Step 1: Define the Saga Steps**
1. **Approve Quote**:
   - Update the `Quote` aggregate to mark it as approved.
   - Publish a `QuoteApproved` event.

2. **Create Policy**:
   - Listen to the `QuoteApproved` event.
   - Create a new `Policy` aggregate.
   - Publish a `PolicyCreated` event.

3. **Update Customer Policy Count**:
   - Listen to the `PolicyCreated` event.
   - Update the `Customer` aggregate’s policy count.
   - Publish a `CustomerPolicyCountUpdated` event.

#### **Step 2: Handle Failures with Compensating Actions**
1. If the `Create Policy` step fails:
   - Publish a `QuoteRejected` event.
   - Revert the `Quote` aggregate to its previous state.

2. If the `Update Customer Policy Count` step fails:
   - Publish a `PolicyCancelled` event.
   - Revert the `Policy` aggregate.

#### **Step 3: Use Idempotency**
- Ensure that each step is idempotent. For example:
  - If the `PolicyCreated` event is processed multiple times, it should not create duplicate policies.

### **5. Example Saga Workflow**
Here’s how the Saga might look in practice:

#### **Step 1: Approve Quote**
```json
{
  "eventID": "event-1",
  "quoteID": "quote-123",
  "eventType": "QuoteApproved",
  "data": {
    "premium": 1200,
    "customerId": "cust-456"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 2: Create Policy**
```json
{
  "eventID": "event-2",
  "policyID": "policy-789",
  "eventType": "PolicyCreated",
  "data": {
    "quoteID": "quote-123",
    "customerId": "cust-456"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Update Customer Policy Count**
```json
{
  "eventID": "event-3",
  "customerId": "cust-456",
  "eventType": "CustomerPolicyCountUpdated",
  "data": {
    "policyCount": 5
  }
}
```

#### **Compensating Action: QuoteRejected**
```json
{
  "eventID": "event-4",
  "quoteID": "quote-123",
  "eventType": "QuoteRejected",
  "data": {
    "reason": "Policy creation failed"
  }
}
```

### **6. Tools for Implementing Sagas**
- **Orchestration Frameworks**:
  - Use frameworks like **Camunda**, **Zeebe**, or **Temporal** to manage Saga workflows.
- **Event-Driven Platforms**:
  - Use messaging systems like **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, or **Azure Service Bus** to publish and consume events.
- **Database Support**:
  - Use Cosmos DB’s Change Feed to trigger Saga steps.

---

### **7. Summary**
- **Consistency Across Aggregates** is a common challenge in distributed systems.
- **Sagas** are the most practical solution for ensuring consistency in the Quoting scenario.
- Use **orchestration** or **choreography** to coordinate the steps of the Saga.
- Implement **compensating actions** to handle failures and ensure eventual consistency.
- Ensure **idempotency** to handle retries and duplicates.

By following this approach, you can ensure that your Quoting system maintains consistency across aggregates while remaining scalable and resilient.
