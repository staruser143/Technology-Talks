To implement this using an event-driven approach with React.js and NestJS, follow these steps:

1. Frontend (React.js)

Use React Context API or Redux to manage state for user responses.

Implement a sidebar component that captures user responses dynamically.

Emit events using WebSockets (Socket.io or native WebSockets) or EventSource (Server-Sent Events, SSE) when the user submits a response.

The plan listing page listens for updates and dynamically re-renders when new plans are received.


Flow

1. User selects an answer in the sidebar → Dispatch an event (question_answered) via WebSockets/EventSource.


2. Frontend listens for filtered plans from the backend (filtered_plans_received).



2. Backend (NestJS)

Use WebSockets (via @nestjs/websockets) or SSE to send updates to clients in real-time.

Implement an event-driven filtering mechanism:

When a user answers a question, publish an event to filter plans.

Use NestJS EventEmitter or Kafka/RabbitMQ if you want distributed event handling.



Flow

1. User response received → Emit UserResponseReceivedEvent (using NestJS EventEmitter or a message broker).


2. Plan Filter Service listens to the event, applies filters, and fetches updated plans.


3. Backend sends filtered plans back to the frontend via WebSockets or SSE.



3. Event Flow Example

1. Frontend (React.js)

User answers a question → socket.emit('question_answered', { userId, questionId, answer })

Listens for filtered_plans_received and updates UI.



2. Backend (NestJS)

@WebSocketGateway() listens for question_answered event.

Emits UserResponseReceivedEvent.

Plan Filter Service applies filters and emits FilteredPlansAvailableEvent.

Gateway sends filtered_plans_received to the frontend.




4. Scaling Considerations

Use Kafka/RabbitMQ if you need message queuing.

Use Redis Pub/Sub for real-time filtering if multiple instances of NestJS are deployed.
