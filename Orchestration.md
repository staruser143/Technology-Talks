Implementing the **orchestration approach** using **Kafka** or **Azure Event Hubs** involves introducing a **central orchestrator** (e.g., a Saga Manager) that coordinates the steps of the Saga by producing and consuming events. The orchestrator is responsible for:
1. **Initiating the Saga**.
2. **Producing commands** to trigger actions in other aggregates.
3. **Listening to events** to determine the next step.
4. **Handling failures** by producing compensating commands.

Let’s break down how to implement the orchestration approach using Kafka or Azure Event Hubs:

---

### **1. Key Components of Orchestration**
- **Orchestrator**: A central service that manages the Saga workflow.
- **Commands**: Messages produced by the orchestrator to trigger actions in other aggregates.
- **Events**: Messages produced by aggregates in response to commands.
- **Compensating Commands**: Messages produced by the orchestrator to undo changes in case of failures.

---

### **2. Example Workflow**
Let’s use the **Quoting scenario** as an example:
1. **Approve Quote**:
   - The orchestrator produces a `CreatePolicy` command.
2. **Create Policy**:
   - The `Policy` aggregate listens to the `CreatePolicy` command and produces a `PolicyCreated` event.
3. **Update Customer Policy Count**:
   - The orchestrator listens to the `PolicyCreated` event and produces an `UpdateCustomerPolicyCount` command.
4. **Handle Failures**:
   - If any step fails, the orchestrator produces compensating commands (e.g., `RejectQuote`).

---

### **3. Implementation with Kafka**

#### **Step 1: Define Topics**
- `saga-commands`: For commands produced by the orchestrator.
- `saga-events`: For events produced by aggregates in response to commands.

#### **Step 2: Orchestrator Workflow**
1. **Initiate Saga**:
   - When a quote is approved, the orchestrator produces a `CreatePolicy` command to the `saga-commands` topic.
     ```json
     {
       "commandID": "command-1",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "commandType": "CreatePolicy",
       "data": {
         "premium": 1200,
         "customerId": "cust-456"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Listen to Events**:
   - The orchestrator listens to the `saga-events` topic for `PolicyCreated` events.
     ```json
     {
       "eventID": "event-2",
       "policyID": "policy-789",
       "eventType": "PolicyCreated",
       "data": {
         "quoteID": "quote-123",
         "customerId": "cust-456"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Produce Next Command**:
   - When the orchestrator receives the `PolicyCreated` event, it produces an `UpdateCustomerPolicyCount` command to the `saga-commands` topic.
     ```json
     {
       "commandID": "command-2",
       "customerId": "cust-456",
       "commandType": "UpdateCustomerPolicyCount",
       "data": {
         "policyCount": 5
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Handle Failures**:
   - If the `Policy` aggregate fails to create a policy, it produces a `PolicyCreationFailed` event to the `saga-events` topic.
     ```json
     {
       "eventID": "event-3",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "eventType": "PolicyCreationFailed",
       "data": {
         "reason": "Invalid premium amount"
       }
     }
     ```
   - The orchestrator listens to the `PolicyCreationFailed` event and produces a `RejectQuote` command to the `saga-commands` topic.
     ```json
     {
       "commandID": "command-3",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "commandType": "RejectQuote",
       "data": {
         "reason": "Policy creation failed"
       }
     }
     ```

### **4. Implementation with Azure Event Hubs**

#### **Step 1: Define Event Hubs**
- `saga-commands`: For commands produced by the orchestrator.
- `saga-events`: For events produced by aggregates in response to commands.

#### **Step 2: Orchestrator Workflow**
1. **Initiate Saga**:
   - When a quote is approved, the orchestrator produces a `CreatePolicy` command to the `saga-commands` hub.
     ```json
     {
       "commandID": "command-1",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "commandType": "CreatePolicy",
       "data": {
         "premium": 1200,
         "customerId": "cust-456"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Listen to Events**:
   - The orchestrator listens to the `saga-events` hub for `PolicyCreated` events.
     ```json
     {
       "eventID": "event-2",
       "policyID": "policy-789",
       "eventType": "PolicyCreated",
       "data": {
         "quoteID": "quote-123",
         "customerId": "cust-456"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Produce Next Command**:
   - When the orchestrator receives the `PolicyCreated` event, it produces an `UpdateCustomerPolicyCount` command to the `saga-commands` hub.
     ```json
     {
       "commandID": "command-2",
       "customerId": "cust-456",
       "commandType": "UpdateCustomerPolicyCount",
       "data": {
         "policyCount": 5
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Handle Failures**:
   - If the `Policy` aggregate fails to create a policy, it produces a `PolicyCreationFailed` event to the `saga-events` hub.
     ```json
     {
       "eventID": "event-3",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "eventType": "PolicyCreationFailed",
       "data": {
         "reason": "Invalid premium amount"
       }
     }
     ```
   - The orchestrator listens to the `PolicyCreationFailed` event and produces a `RejectQuote` command to the `saga-commands` hub.
     ```json
     {
       "commandID": "command-3",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "commandType": "RejectQuote",
       "data": {
         "reason": "Policy creation failed"
       }
     }
     ```

### **5. Key Considerations**

#### **a. Orchestrator State**
- The orchestrator needs to maintain the state of each Saga instance (e.g., `quoteID`, current step, status).
- Use a database (e.g., Cosmos DB) to store the state of each Saga.

#### **b. Idempotency**
- Ensure that commands and events are idempotent to handle retries and duplicates.
- Example:
  - Before creating a policy, check if it already exists.

#### **c. Monitoring and Retries**
- Use dead-letter queues (DLQs) to handle commands or events that cannot be processed after multiple retries.
- Example:
  - If the `Policy` aggregate fails to process a `CreatePolicy` command multiple times, move the command to a DLQ for manual inspection.

#### **d. Scalability**
- Use **partition keys** (e.g., `quoteID`) to ensure events and commands for the same Saga instance are processed sequentially.
- Example:
  - In Kafka, use the `quoteID` as the partition key for the `saga-commands` and `saga-events` topics.

### **6. Tools for Orchestration**
- **Orchestration Frameworks**:
  - Use frameworks like **Camunda**, **Zeebe**, or **Temporal** to manage Saga workflows.
- **Custom Orchestrator**:
  - Build a custom orchestrator using a microservice that produces commands and listens to events.

---

### **7. Summary**
- The **orchestration approach** uses a central orchestrator to coordinate the steps of the Saga.
- The orchestrator produces **commands** to trigger actions in aggregates and listens to **events** to determine the next step.
- Use **Kafka** or **Azure Event Hubs** to produce and consume commands and events.
- Ensure **idempotency**, **durability**, and **scalability** to handle failures and retries.

By implementing the orchestration approach, you can ensure consistency across aggregates in the Quoting scenario while maintaining scalability and resilience.
