Interpreting the radar chart is straightforward once you understand what each axis and shape represents. Here's a breakdown:

### 🕸️ **Radar Chart Overview**

A **radar chart** (also called a spider or web chart) is used to compare multiple variables across different categories. In this chart:

- Each **axis** represents a key feature of AI in healthcare:
  - **Scope**
  - **Autonomy**
  - **Adaptability**
  - **Initiative**
  - **Human Involvement**
- The **distance from the center** indicates the level or strength of that feature (higher is better, except for Human Involvement, where lower is better).
- Two colored shapes represent the two types of AI:
  - 🟦 **Blue**: Traditional AI
  - 🟩 **Green**: Agentic AI

---

### 🔍 **How to Read It**

- **Scope**: Agentic AI scores higher, meaning it handles broader, more complex tasks.
- **Autonomy**: Agentic AI operates more independently than Traditional AI.
- **Adaptability**: Agentic AI can learn and adjust over time; Traditional AI is more static.
- **Initiative**: Agentic AI acts proactively; Traditional AI waits for input.
- **Human Involvement**: Traditional AI needs more human oversight, while Agentic AI requires less (so a lower score here is better).

### ✅ **Key Takeaway**

The **larger and more outward-reaching the green shape**, the more capable Agentic AI is across these dimensions. The **blue shape** is smaller and closer to the center, showing that Traditional AI is more limited and dependent.
