- **Break-even for Premium (1 MU):**  
  **≈ 1.29 billion operations/month** (same as before).

- **Break-even for Premium (2 MUs):**  
  **Not reached within 2 billion operations/month** (Standard remains cheaper even at 2B ops if Premium uses 2 MUs).

---

### **Why?**
- Premium with 2 MUs doubles the base cost (≈ \$1,364/month), so Standard would need **well over 2B operations/month** to surpass that cost.

---

### **Key Insight**
- **Premium (1 MU)** becomes cost-effective at very high throughput (~1.29B ops/month).
- **Premium (2 MUs)** is justified **only for performance, latency, or compliance reasons**, not cost savings, unless your workload is **extremely high** (multi-billion ops/month).
