**VNet support in Azure Service Bus Premium** refers to the ability to **securely integrate your Service Bus namespace with an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** using **Private Endpoints** and **Service Endpoints**, which is **not available in Basic or Standard tiers**. Here’s what it means:

---

### ✅ **What Premium Tier Offers for VNet Integration**
1. **Private Endpoints via Azure Private Link**
   - Creates a **private IP address** in your VNet that maps to your Service Bus namespace.
   - All traffic flows through the **Microsoft backbone network**, avoiding the public internet.
   - Eliminates the need for **VPN, ExpressRoute, NAT, or public IPs**.
   - Provides **granular access control** at the subnet level.
   - Supported **only in Premium tier**.[1](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/service-bus-messaging/private-link-service)

2. **VNet Service Endpoints**
   - Creates a **secure tunnel** from your VNet subnet to the Service Bus service.
   - Restricts access so only resources in the VNet can reach the Service Bus.
   - **Important:** Once enabled, the VNet endpoint works **only with Premium namespaces** (Standard and Basic do not support this).[2](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/messagingonazureblog/mixing-standard-and-premium-service-bus-with-vnet-service-endpoints/370907)

3. **Network-Level Security**
   - Ability to **disable public network access** and allow **only private access**.
   - Integration with **firewall rules**, **IP filtering**, and **trusted Azure services**.
   - Useful for **compliance and data protection** in regulated industries.[3](https://markheath.net/post/azure-service-bus-messaging-9)

### ❌ **What Basic and Standard Lack**
- No support for **VNet integration**, **private endpoints**, or **service endpoints**.
- They rely on **public internet access** (secured via SAS tokens or Azure AD).
- Cannot enforce **network isolation**.

---

### ✅ **When to Use Premium for VNet Integration**
- **Highly regulated environments** (finance, healthcare, government).
- **Mission-critical apps** requiring **private connectivity** and **zero public exposure**.
- **Hybrid or multi-tier architectures** where security boundaries are strict.
