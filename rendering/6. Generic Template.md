Exactly. That is the "secret sauce" of a high-scale document service. Instead of building a template for a **"Price List"** and another for a **"User Directory,"** you build a generic **"Grid Template"** that doesn't care what the data is—it only cares about the **shape** of the data.

When you pass `columns: 2` and a list of `cards` via YAML, the FreeMarker template acts as a flexible renderer.

### 1. How the Generic Template Works

The `.ftl` file uses FreeMarker's logic tags (`<#list>`, `<#if>`, `<#assign>`) to interpret the layout instructions provided by the YAML.

**`info_grid.ftl` (The Generic Renderer):**

```html
<style>
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    /* Dynamically set columns from YAML */
    grid-template-columns: repeat(${layout_config.columns!3}, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
  }
  .card { border: 1px solid ${layout_config.theme_color!'#ccc'}; }
</style>

<div class="grid-container">
  <#list cards as card>
    <div class="card">
      <h4>${card.title}</h4>
      <p>${card.description}</p>
    </div>
  </#list>
</div>

```

### 2. One Template, Multiple Identities

By changing only the YAML configuration, you can reuse this single `.ftl` file for entirely different business needs:

| Use Case | YAML `columns` | YAML `data_mapping` for `cards` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product Catalog** | `3` | `title: "$.item.name"`, `description: "$.item.specs"` |
| **Staff Directory** | `4` | `title: "$.emp.fullName"`, `description: "$.emp.role"` |
| **Alert Summary** | `1` | `title: "$.err.code"`, `description: "$.err.msg"` |

### 3. Handling Complex Nested Content

If the content inside those columns is also dynamic (e.g., some cards have images, others have tables), you can use the **"Polymorphic Component"** pattern.

In your YAML, you define the `type` of content:

```yaml
cards:
  - title: "Quarterly Revenue"
    type: "table"
    data: "$.finance.table"
  - title: "Executive Summary"
    type: "text"
    data: "$.summary.paragraph"

```

In your FreeMarker, you use a "Switch" statement:

```html
<#list cards as card>
  <div class="card">
    <#if card.type == "table">
       <@renderTable card.data />
    <#else if card.type == "text">
       <p>${card.data}</p>
    </#if>
  </div>
</#list>

```

---

### 4. The Benefit: "Template Minimalism"

Without this declarative approach, a document service often ends up with hundreds of templates (e.g., `invoice_v1.ftl`, `invoice_client_b.ftl`, etc.).

With this approach, you might only need **5–10 core templates**:

1. **`standard_table.ftl`** (handles all tabular data)
2. **`key_value_pairs.ftl`** (for headers/summaries)
3. **`grid_layout.ftl`** (for dashboard-style pages)
4. **`flow_text.ftl`** (for legal/prose text)
5. **`acro_wrapper.java`** (to handle the PDF Form logic)

### Why this is powerful for you:

When a client asks for a change, you don't look for the "Client X Template." You look for the **"Client X YAML."** You change a mapping or a column count, and the document updates instantly without a single line of Java code being compiled.
