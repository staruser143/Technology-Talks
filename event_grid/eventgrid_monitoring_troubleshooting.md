Azure Event Grid offers several options for monitoring and troubleshooting to ensure smooth operation and quick resolution of issues. Here are the key features:

1. **Diagnostic Logs**:
   - Enable diagnostic settings for Event Grid topics or domains to capture and view publish and delivery failure logs. This helps in identifying issues with event delivery and processing[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/troubleshoot-issues?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

2. **Metrics**:
   - You can view metrics for Event Grid topics and subscriptions. Metrics provide insights into the number of events published, delivery success rates, and latencies. You can create charts and set alerts based on these metrics[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/monitor-event-delivery?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

3. **Alerts**:
   - Create alerts on Azure Event Grid metrics and activity log operations. Alerts can notify you of any anomalies or issues, allowing you to take immediate action[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/monitor-event-delivery?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

4. **Subscription Validation Issues**:
   - During event subscription creation, you may encounter validation errors. Azure Event Grid provides detailed error messages to help troubleshoot these issues[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/troubleshoot-issues?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

5. **Network Connectivity Issues**:
   - Troubleshoot connectivity issues that may prevent client applications from connecting to an Event Grid topic or domain. This includes both permanent and transient connectivity problems[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/troubleshoot-issues?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

6. **Error Codes**:
   - Azure Event Grid provides specific error codes (e.g., 400, 409, 403) to help diagnose and resolve issues. Detailed documentation is available to understand and address these errors[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/troubleshoot-issues?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

7. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Event Grid supports distributed tracing, allowing you to trace events across different services and components. This helps in understanding the flow of events and identifying bottlenecks or failures[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/troubleshoot-issues?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").

8. **Azure Monitor Integration**:
   - Azure Event Grid integrates with Azure Monitor, providing a comprehensive set of features to monitor the availability, performance, and operation of Event Grid resources. You can analyze metrics, set up alerts, and route logs to various destinations[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/monitor-namespaces?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

By leveraging these monitoring and troubleshooting options, you can ensure the reliability and efficiency of your event-driven applications using Azure Event Grid.
