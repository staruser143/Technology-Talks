The purpose of the `validationCode` in Azure Event Grid is to confirm and validate the webhook endpoint when you create an event subscription. When you set up a new event subscription with a webhook endpoint, Azure Event Grid sends a validation event to the endpoint URL you specified. This validation event contains a `validationCode`.

Hereâ€™s why this step is important:

1. **Endpoint Verification**: It verifies that the endpoint is capable of receiving and responding to events. This is especially crucial to ensure that Event Grid is communicating with a legitimate and functional endpoint.

2. **Security**: It prevents malicious entities from hijacking event subscriptions or sending events to unintended endpoints.

Here is how the process typically works:

1. **Event Grid sends a validation event**: This event contains a `validationCode` that needs to be echoed back by your endpoint.

   Example validation event payload:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "validationCode": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab",
       "validationUrl": "https://example.com/validationUrl"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Your endpoint responds with the validation code**: Your service needs to extract the `validationCode` and respond to the Event Grid with it.

   Example response:
   ```json
   {
     "validationResponse": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab"
   }
   ```

3. **Event Grid confirms the subscription**: Once Event Grid receives the correct validation response, it confirms the event subscription, and your webhook endpoint is now ready to receive events.

By handling the validation event correctly, you ensure that your endpoint is recognized and accepted by Azure Event Grid. This validation process is essential to maintain the integrity and security of event delivery.
