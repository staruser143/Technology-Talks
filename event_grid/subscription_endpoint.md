Azure Event Grid supports various types of endpoints for event subscriptions. Here are the main types you can use:

1. **Webhook**: Allows you to specify any publicly accessible HTTP/HTTPS endpoint. Events will be sent as HTTP POST requests.

2. **Azure Function**: Ideal for serverless event processing. You can trigger an Azure Function whenever an event is received.

3. **Azure Logic Apps**: Useful for creating workflows that integrate various services. An event can trigger a Logic App to perform complex sequences of actions.

4. **Azure Event Hubs**: Events can be sent to an Event Hub for real-time data ingestion and processing.

5. **Azure Service Bus**: Events can be sent to Service Bus Queues or Topics for reliable message delivery and decoupling of event producers and consumers.

6. **Azure Storage Queues**: Events can be sent to a Storage Queue for simple, low-cost message queuing.

Each of these endpoints has its own strengths and use cases. Depending on your requirements, you can choose the most suitable option.
