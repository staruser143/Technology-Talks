No, Azure Event Grid and Azure Event Hubs are designed for different purposes, and their handling of events reflects that.

- **Azure Event Grid**: Primarily focused on event routing, it ensures that events are delivered to their intended subscribers. Event Grid does not store events for long-term retention. It provides a highly reliable, low-latency event delivery mechanism but doesn't have built-in storage for historical event data. Once an event is successfully delivered to the subscribers, it is essentially discarded by Event Grid.

- **Azure Event Hubs**: Designed for large-scale data streaming and event ingestion, it provides both event processing and storage capabilities. Event Hubs can retain events for a configured retention period (ranging from a few hours to several days), enabling consumers to reprocess past events if needed. This makes Event Hubs suitable for scenarios requiring the analysis or replay of historical event data.

In summary, if you need to store events for later processing or analysis, Azure Event Hubs is the appropriate service. If your goal is to route events to various endpoints in real-time without the need for storing them, Azure Event Grid is the right choice.
