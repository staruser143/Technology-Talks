The **orchestrator** can read events from **Cosmos DB** in two ways, depending on your architecture and requirements:

1. **Directly from Cosmos DB Change Feed**.
2. **Indirectly via Kafka/Azure Event Hubs** (after events are published to the messaging platform).

Letâ€™s explore both approaches and their trade-offs:

---

### **1. Directly from Cosmos DB Change Feed**

In this approach, the orchestrator listens to the **Cosmos DB Change Feed** to read events as they are appended to the Event Store.

#### **How It Works**:
- The **Change Feed** is a feature of Cosmos DB that provides a log of changes (inserts and updates) to a container.
- The orchestrator listens to the Change Feed and processes new events as they are appended.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Append Event to Cosmos DB**:
   - When an aggregate changes state, append an event to the Cosmos DB container.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "eventID": "event-1",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "eventType": "QuoteApproved",
       "sequenceNumber": 1,
       "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z",
       "data": {
         "premium": 1200,
         "customerId": "cust-456"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Orchestrator Listens to Change Feed**:
   - The orchestrator uses the **Change Feed Processor** to listen for new events.
   - Example (pseudo-code):
     ```csharp
     var processor = container.GetChangeFeedProcessorBuilder<Event>("processorName", HandleChangesAsync)
         .WithInstanceName("instanceName")
         .WithLeaseContainer(leaseContainer)
         .Build();
     ```

3. **Process Events**:
   - The orchestrator processes each event and produces commands to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
   - Example:
     - When the orchestrator receives a `QuoteApproved` event, it produces a `CreatePolicy` command.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Real-time processing**: Events are processed as soon as they are appended to Cosmos DB.
- **No additional infrastructure**: No need to introduce Kafka/Azure Event Hubs for event publishing.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Tight coupling**: The orchestrator is tightly coupled to Cosmos DB.
- **Scalability**: The Change Feed Processor scales based on the number of partitions in Cosmos DB, which might not be sufficient for very high throughput.

---

### **2. Indirectly via Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**

In this approach, events are first published to **Kafka** or **Azure Event Hubs**, and the orchestrator reads events from the messaging platform.

#### **How It Works**:
- When an event is appended to Cosmos DB, it is also published to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
- The orchestrator listens to the messaging platform for events and processes them.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Append Event to Cosmos DB**:
   - When an aggregate changes state, append an event to the Cosmos DB container.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "eventID": "event-1",
       "quoteID": "quote-123",
       "eventType": "QuoteApproved",
       "sequenceNumber": 1,
       "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z",
       "data": {
         "premium": 1200,
         "customerId": "cust-456"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Publish Event to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**:
   - Use a **Change Feed Trigger** (e.g., Azure Functions) to publish events to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
   - Example (Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Trigger):
     ```csharp
     [FunctionName("PublishEvent")]
     public static async Task Run(
         [CosmosDBTrigger(
             databaseName: "EventStore",
             collectionName: "Events",
             ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
             LeaseCollectionName = "leases")]
         IReadOnlyList<Event> events,
         [EventHub("saga-events", Connection = "EventHubConnection")] IAsyncCollector<Event> eventHubMessages)
     {
         foreach (var event in events)
         {
             await eventHubMessages.AddAsync(event);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Orchestrator Listens to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**:
   - The orchestrator listens to the `saga-events` topic/hub for events.
   - Example (Kafka consumer):
     ```python
     from kafka import KafkaConsumer

     consumer = KafkaConsumer(
         'saga-events',
         bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
         group_id='orchestrator'
     )

     for message in consumer:
         event = message.value
         process_event(event)
     ```

4. **Process Events**:
   - The orchestrator processes each event and produces commands to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
   - Example:
     - When the orchestrator receives a `QuoteApproved` event, it produces a `CreatePolicy` command.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Decoupling**: The orchestrator is decoupled from Cosmos DB and only interacts with the messaging platform.
- **Scalability**: Kafka/Azure Event Hubs can handle very high throughput and provide better scalability.
- **Reusability**: Other services can also subscribe to the same events.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Additional infrastructure**: Requires setting up and managing Kafka/Azure Event Hubs.
- **Latency**: Slightly higher latency due to the additional step of publishing events to the messaging platform.

### **3. Which Approach to Choose?**

| **Criteria**                | **Change Feed**                              | **Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**                  |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Real-time processing**     | Yes                                         | Slightly higher latency                     |
| **Decoupling**               | Tightly coupled to Cosmos DB                | Decoupled from Cosmos DB                    |
| **Scalability**              | Limited by Cosmos DB partitions             | Highly scalable                             |
| **Infrastructure complexity**| Minimal                                     | Requires Kafka/Azure Event Hubs setup       |
| **Reusability**              | Events are only available to the orchestrator| Events can be consumed by multiple services |

- **Choose Change Feed** if:
  - You want real-time processing with minimal infrastructure.
  - The orchestrator is the only consumer of events.
  - Your throughput requirements are moderate.

- **Choose Kafka/Azure Event Hubs** if:
  - You need high scalability and throughput.
  - You want to decouple the orchestrator from Cosmos DB.
  - Multiple services need to consume the same events.

---

### **4. Hybrid Approach**
You can also use a **hybrid approach**:
- Use the **Change Feed** for real-time event processing by the orchestrator.
- Publish events to **Kafka/Azure Event Hubs** for other services to consume.

#### **Example**:
1. The orchestrator listens to the Change Feed for real-time processing.
2. A separate process (e.g., Azure Function) publishes events to Kafka/Azure Event Hubs for other services.

---

### **5. Summary**
- **Change Feed**: Directly read events from Cosmos DB for real-time processing by the orchestrator.
- **Kafka/Azure Event Hubs**: Publish events to a messaging platform for decoupling and scalability.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine both methods for real-time processing and event distribution.

By choosing the right approach based on your requirements, you can ensure that your orchestrator reads events efficiently and processes them in a scalable and decoupled manner.
