Handling failure scenarios while using the Azure Cosmos DB Change Feed Processor is critical for building a reliable, fault-tolerant system. Below are best practices and techniques to handle various failure scenarios effectively.


---

1. Built-in Retry Mechanism

The Change Feed Processor automatically retries operations on transient failures (e.g., network issues or partition load balancing).


What You Should Do

Focus on idempotent event processing so that retries do not lead to inconsistent data.

Catch and log critical errors in the event processing handler.



---

2. Custom Error Handling in Event Processing

Implement robust error handling for exceptions in the event handler (setHandleChanges()).

Example: Enhanced Error Handling

setHandleChanges(async (changes) => {
  try {
    for (const change of changes) {
      console.log('Processing change:', change);
      await this.writeToReadModel(change);  // Ensure this operation is idempotent
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing changes:', error);
    // Handle specific error types if needed
    await this.logError(error, changes);
  }
});

Recommendations

Log Errors: Capture failure details for diagnostics.

Fallback Handling: Redirect failed events to an error queue or dead-letter storage for manual inspection.

Notification: Set up alerts for persistent errors using monitoring tools like Azure Monitor.



---

3. Handling Partition Failures

The Change Feed Processor automatically handles partition rebalancing, but persistent partition failures need to be monitored.

Best Practices

Monitor lease container health for signs of partition issues.

Use Azure Metrics to monitor ChangeFeedProcessor.PartitionHealth metrics.



---

4. Idempotent Processing

Ensure the event processing logic is idempotent, meaning re-processing the same event doesn't lead to data inconsistencies.

How to Ensure Idempotency

Use unique identifiers for processed events in the read model.

Maintain a record of processed events using metadata.



---

5. Checkpointing Failures

Checkpointing ensures that the Change Feed Processor doesn't reprocess the same events.

What to Do

Regularly validate that checkpoints are being updated in the lease container.

Handle errors during checkpoint writes by logging and monitoring.


Example: Checkpoint Handling

this.changeFeedProcessor = sourceContainer.items.changeFeedProcessor('event-processor')
  .setLeaseContainer(leaseContainer)
  .setHandleChanges(async (changes, context) => {
    try {
      await processChanges(changes);
      await context.checkpoint();  // Explicit checkpointing
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to process changes or checkpoint:', error);
    }
  });


---

6. Lease Container Failures

The lease container holds checkpoint and partition information.

Recommendations

Ensure the lease container has adequate RU/s to handle checkpoint operations.

Monitor lease container health using Azure metrics.

Use a dedicated lease container rather than mixing it with other workloads.



---

7. Monitoring and Diagnostics

Enable Application Insights and Azure Monitor for tracking:

RU consumption

Error rates

Partition load balancing

Latency and throughput metrics



---

8. Handling Poison Messages

If certain events cannot be processed, send them to an error handling service or dead-letter queue.

Example

async function processChange(change) {
  try {
    await this.writeToReadModel(change);
  } catch (error) {
    await this.sendToDeadLetterQueue(change, error);
  }
}


---

9. High Availability and Scaling

Deploy multiple instances of the Change Feed Processor service to handle load efficiently.

Use Cosmos DB autoscaling for source and lease containers to handle variable traffic.
