#### **Company Profile**:
A mid-sized FinTech company runs a web-based trading platform hosted on AWS. Their backend services are deployed on **Amazon EC2 instances**, and they‚Äôve noticed rising costs without a proportional increase in traffic.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Challenge**:
- EC2 instances were **over-provisioned** to handle peak loads.
- Most of the time, CPU and memory usage remained low.
- Manual rightsizing was time-consuming and error-prone.

---

### üß† **Solution with AWS Compute Optimizer**:
1. **Enable Compute Optimizer** across their AWS accounts.
2. Let it analyze **14 days of CloudWatch metrics** for EC2 instances.
3. Receive recommendations like:
   - Downgrade `m5.4xlarge` to `m5.2xlarge` for certain services.
   - Switch from `gp2` to `gp3` EBS volumes for better cost-efficiency.
   - Increase memory allocation for Lambda functions that were timing out.

---

### üí° **Results**:
- **30% reduction in EC2 costs** by rightsizing instances.
- **Improved performance** for under-provisioned Lambda functions.
- **Simplified resource planning** for future deployments.
