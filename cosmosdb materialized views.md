If you're looking for alternatives to materialized views in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, especially while they remain in preview or if you need a solution with more established production readiness, consider these approaches:
1. Change Feed and External Read Models:
 * How it works:
   * Use the Cosmos DB change feed to stream changes from your source container to an external data store.
   * Create read models in that external store (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB in a different container with a different partition key, or even a search service like Azure Cognitive Search).
   * This is the most common and robust approach.
 * Advantages:
   * Full control over the read model's structure and indexing.
   * Scalability and flexibility.
   * Decoupling of read and write workloads.
   * Production ready.
 * Considerations:
   * Requires implementing and managing the change feed processing logic.
   * Adds complexity to your architecture.
   * You are responsible for the consistency of the data.
 * When to use:
   * When you need highly optimized read models.
   * When you require flexibility in the read model's structure.
   * When you need to integrate with other data stores.
2. Denormalization Within the Same Container:
 * How it works:
   * Store denormalized data within the same Cosmos DB container.
   * Duplicate relevant data fields to avoid the need for joins or complex queries.
 * Advantages:
   * Simplified queries and reduced RU consumption.
   * No need for external data stores.
   * Easier to implement.
 * Considerations:
   * Increased storage costs due to data duplication.
   * Requires careful management of data consistency.
   * Can lead to larger document sizes.
 * When to use:
   * For simple denormalization scenarios.
   * When you need to optimize read performance for specific queries.
   * When you want to minimize architectural complexity.
3. Computed Properties:
 * How it works:
   * Calculate and store computed properties within your Cosmos DB documents.
   * This can eliminate the need for real-time calculations during queries.
 * Advantages:
   * Improved query performance.
   * Reduced RU consumption.
 * Considerations:
   * Requires updating computed properties when source data changes.
   * Can increase document size.
 * When to use:
   * For simple computations that are frequently used in queries.
4. Azure Cognitive Search:
 * How it works:
   * Use the Cosmos DB change feed to index data in Azure Cognitive Search.
   * Perform complex search queries against the search index.
 * Advantages:
   * Powerful search capabilities.
   * Optimized for text search and filtering.
   * Handles complex search scenarios.
 * Considerations:
   * Adds an external search service.
   * Requires managing the search index.
 * When to use:
   * When you need full-text search capabilities.
   * When you need complex filtering and sorting.
Key Considerations:
 * Choose the alternative that best aligns with your specific requirements, including performance, scalability, and complexity.
 * Consider the trade-offs between data duplication, consistency, and architectural complexity.
By using these alternatives, you can effectively address your read performance needs in Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
