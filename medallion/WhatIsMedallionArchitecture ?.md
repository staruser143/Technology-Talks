## What is Medallion Architecture?
Medallion Architecture (also known as **Multi-Hop Architecture**) is a data lakehouse design pattern that organizes data into different layers or **"medallions"** — typically **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** — to improve **data quality, manageability, and performance across the data lifecycle**.
## Layers in Medallion Architecture:
|       | Purpose  | Characteristics   | Usage   |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)** | Ingest raw data from various sources (e.g., databases, logs, streaming data).  | Data is stored as-is, without much transformation.High voume, low quality, schema may evolve.   | Audit, traceability, replay for new processing   |
| **Silver Layer (Cleaned and Enriched Data)** | Clean, filter, and join datasets from Bronze to create refined datasets.   | Handles data quality, type casting, de-uplication. Schema enforced. Ready for downstream analytics, but not fully modeled.   | Used for creating data marts, aggregates, machine learning features   |
| **Gold Layer (Business-Level Data)** | Aggregate, summarize, and model data for business consumption   | Highly curated datasets.Optimized for reporting and analytics.   | Used directly in dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics   |
## When Should You Use Medallion Architecture?

  <tr>
    <th align='left'>When dealing with large-scale data lakes or lakehouses</th>
    <td>Enables systematic processing and layering of data for improved governance and efficiency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align='left'>For data that comes from multiple, complex, or semi-structured sources</th>
    <td>Allows raw data to be ingested first, then incrementally processed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align='left'>When data quality and auditability are important</th>
    <td>Raw data in Bronze layer ensures you always have an unmodified copy.  Silver and Gold layers ensure progressive refinement and quality assurance</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <th align='left'>When you need to serve diverse use cases</th>
    <td>Data scientists (may use Silver), business analysts (may use Gold), and engineers (may use Bronze).</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <th align='left'>For optimizing performance and cost in data processing pipelines</th>
    <td>Avoids reprocessing raw data for every use case by reusing Silver and Gold datasets.</td>

## When Not to Use?
* For small, simple datasets with straightforward transformations.
* If low latency or real-time data needs are the only priority (though can be adapted for streaming with Delta Live Tables or similar tech).
* When a fully structured and predefined schema is always ensured upstream (e.g., data warehouse-centric systems).
