# Decision Guide for Choosing Databricks Notebooks vs Databricks Jobs
Here's a clear textual flowchart/decision guide to help you decide between Databricks Notebooks vs. Databricks Jobs in a structured way:

## Decision Flowchart (Text Format):

* **Step 1**: Are you in a development or exploration phase?
**Yes** → Use Databricks Notebooks
( **Reason**: Notebooks are great for interactive data exploration, prototyping, and testing logic).
* **No** → Go to **Step 2**

* **Step 2**: Is this process meant to run automatically on a schedule or as part of a pipeline?
**Yes** → Use Databricks Jobs
(**Reason**: Jobs support scheduling, automation, error handling, and monitoring).
* **No** → Go to **Step 3**


* **Step 3**: Do you need to interactively analyze, visualize, or tweak code while running?
**Yes** → Use Databricks Notebooks
(**Reason**: Notebooks allow running code in cells, visualizing results, and making iterative changes).
**No** → Go to **Step 4**

* **Step 4** : Do you need robust error handling, retries, notifications, and dependencies between multiple tasks?
**Yes** → Use Databricks Jobs (with multi-task jobs)
(**Reason**: Jobs offer full production-grade orchestration features like retries, alerts, and task dependencies).
**No** → If still unclear, consider:

* For ad-hoc data runs: **Notebook**
* For consistent, repeatable production runs: **Job**

## Summary Table for Quick Comparison
|           | Databricks Notebook   | Databricks Job |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** |Interactive Development,Exploration & Testing              |Production Grade, Automated and Scheduled Runs       |
| **Interactivity** | High (Run Cell by Cell , visualize              |None (Runs Start to Finish Automatically)       |
| **Scheduling & Automation** | Not Supported              | Fully Supported       |
| **Monitoring & Alerts** | Minimal (Manual)              | Built-in monitoring, alerts, retries       |
| **Multi-step workflows with dependencies** | No              | Yes, Multi-Task Jobs       |
| **Integration with ADF & Pipelines** | Limited without wrapping in a Job              | Directly callable as an ADF Activity       |
| **Error Handling & Retries** | Manaul              | Automatic Retries & Error Handling       |
| **Parameterization for Dynamic Runs** | Limited (Widgets for manual input)              | Full Parameter Support       |
| **Use for Ad-hoc Analytics and Exploration** | Yes              | No       |
| **Use for Production Data Pipelines** | No              | Yes       |


## Final Recommendation:
* **If interactive, exploratory, or development use case → Databricks Notebook.**
* **If automated, production, scheduled, with monitoring needs → Databricks Job.**
