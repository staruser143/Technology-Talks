Excellent follow-up! Yes, Apache Iceberg is a strong alternative to Delta Lake, and both serve a similar purpose: enabling ACID transactions, schema evolution, time travel, and efficient querying on data lakes. But there are important differences in features, ecosystem integration, and cloud platform readiness — especially in an Azure + Databricks context.

Let me break this down clearly:


---

1. What is Apache Iceberg?

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for large analytic datasets.

It brings ACID transactions, schema evolution, partition evolution, and time travel capabilities to data lakes independently of Delta Lake.

Iceberg is cloud-agnostic and designed to work with multiple compute engines like Spark, Trino, Presto, Flink, Hive, Dremio, Snowflake.

3. Why Consider Iceberg over Delta Lake?

a. Multi-Engine Interoperability

If you want your data to be queryable by multiple engines (Spark, Trino, Flink, Snowflake, Dremio), Iceberg is often a better fit.

Delta Lake is still catching up on this (even though Delta Universal Format is in progress).


b. Partition Evolution

Iceberg supports partition evolution, which means you can change partitioning strategy over time without rewriting all historical data — Delta doesn't support this easily.


c. Cloud and Vendor Neutral

Iceberg is not tied to any single cloud or vendor — if multi-cloud or avoiding vendor lock-in is a goal, Iceberg wins here.

4. Why Choose Delta Lake with Databricks in Azure?

a. Deep Native Integration

Delta Lake is natively integrated and optimized for Databricks on Azure, including runtime optimizations, caching, and Delta Live Tables (DLT).

Unity Catalog for governance works out-of-the-box with Delta Lake.


b. Performance

Features like Z-Ordering, Data Skipping, and Photon engine make Delta extremely performance-optimized for large workloads.


c. Simplicity

If you are using Databricks, Delta is often simpler to manage because it's part of the ecosystem — no need to manage Iceberg catalog/metastore separately.


d. Delta Sharing (open sharing protocol)

Delta has Delta Sharing, allowing you to share data in a controlled way — Iceberg lacks a universal sharing protocol.

7. Final Recommendation for Your Scenario (If Databricks is Main Engine)

Since you are discussing Azure Databricks and Medallion Architecture, Delta Lake is the natural fit because:

Tight integration with Databricks runtime.

Easy schema enforcement, schema evolution.

Built-in ACID and time travel.

Native integration with Unity Catalog for security/governance.

Optimized query performance.

Managed infrastructure (you don’t have to set up Iceberg catalog, metastore, etc.).


However, if in the future you want a more open, multi-engine architecture, and especially if you're integrating with Trino/Presto/Flink, Iceberg is a great candidate to consider — but requires more setup and is less mature in Azure as of now.
