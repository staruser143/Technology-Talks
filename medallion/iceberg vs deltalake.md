# What is Apache Iceberg?
* Apache Iceberg is a strong alternative to Delta Lake, and both serve a similar purpose: enabling ACID transactions, schema evolution, time travel, and efficient querying on data lakes. 
* But there are important differences in features, ecosystem integration, and cloud platform readiness — especially in an Azure + Databricks context.
* Apache Iceberg is an open table format for large analytic datasets.
* It brings ACID transactions, schema evolution, partition evolution, and time travel capabilities to data lakes independently of Delta Lake.
* Iceberg is cloud-agnostic and designed to work with multiple compute engines like Spark, Trino, Presto, Flink, Hive, Dremio, Snowflake.

## Delta Lake vs. Apache Iceberg — Quick Comparison
| Feature    | Delta Lake  | Apache Iceberg   |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **ACID Transactions**  | Yes (Optimized for Spark)   |Yes         |
| **Time Travel**  | Yes   | Yes         |
| **Schema Evolution**  | Yes (rich,flexibile)   | Yes, (flexible)         |
| **Partition Evolution**  | Limited(with workarounds)  | Native support for partition evolution         |
| **Cloud Vendor**  | Strongly backed by Databricks, Azure natively supports Delta  | Open-source, vendor neutral        |
| **Performance Optimization (Z-order)**  | Yes, (Databricks proprietary | No native Z-order,but other optimizations        |
| **Engine Interoperability**  | Spark,Presto,Trino(limited) | Spark,Flink,Trino,Presto,Snowflake etc       |
| **Adoption & Maturity in Azure**  | Highly Mature(With Databricks) | Emerging,Growing(Via Synapse & Others)       |
| **Microsoft native support**  | Deep integration in Azure Databricks and now in Synapse | Early stages of support (Synapse + Fabric)       |
| **Governance/Unity Catalog**  | Full support via Unity Catalog | Partial (depends on vendor, Project Nessie as option)       |

## Why Consider Iceberg over Delta Lake?
<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Multi-Engine Interoperability</th>
    <td>If you want your data to be queryable by multiple engines (Spark, Trino, Flink, Snowflake, Dremio), Iceberg is often a better fit.Delta Lake is still catching up on this (even though Delta Universal Format is in progress).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Partition Evolution</th>
    <td>Iceberg supports partition evolution, which means you can change partitioning strategy over time without rewriting all historical data — Delta doesn't support this easily.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cloud and Vendor Neutral</th>
    <td>Iceberg is not tied to any single cloud or vendor — if multi-cloud or avoiding vendor lock-in is a goal, Iceberg wins here.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Why Choose Delta Lake with Databricks in Azure?
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Deep Native Integration</th>
    <td>Delta Lake is natively integrated and optimized for Databricks on Azure, including runtime optimizations, caching, and Delta Live Tables (DLT).Unity Catalog for governance works out-of-the-box with Delta Lake.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Performance</th>
    <td>Features like Z-Ordering, Data Skipping, and Photon engine make Delta extremely performance-optimized for large workloads.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Simplicity</th>
    <td>If you are using Databricks, Delta is often simpler to manage because it's part of the ecosystem — no need to manage Iceberg catalog/metastore separately.</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <th>Delta Sharing (open sharing protocol)</th>
    <td>Delta has Delta Sharing, allowing you to share data in a controlled way — Iceberg lacks a universal sharing protocol.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Current State in Azure
   
|    Aspect   | Delta Lake on Databricks       | Iceberg in Azure  |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Native support in azure Databricks**   | Yes (fully integrated, optimized)                      | Limited/Experimental (Still Maturing)         |
| **Support in Azure Synapse**   | Basic Parquet-based access to Delta (limited)                       | Iceberg now supported via Synapze Spark(Preview)          | 
| **Integration With Azure Preview,Security**   | Yes, Via Unity Catalog                      | Not Seamless (Requires manual setup)
| **Performance Optimization**   | Yes, Z-order,Photon Engine                     | Less Mature, depends on the engine|


## When to Use Iceberg Instead of Delta in Azure?

| Scenario   | Recommendation  |
|------------|------------------------|
| **You want open,multi-engine support (Spark,Flink , Trino)**  | Iceberg   |
| **You are building a multi-cloud solution(Azure+GCP+AWS)**  | Iceberg  |
| **Your compute engines are non-Databricks(Eg, Trino,Flink**  | Iceberg   |
| **Your main engine is Databricks and you want fastest performance**  | Delta Lake   |
| **You want fully integrated governance, access control (Unity Catalog)**  | Delta Lake (With Databricks)  |
| **You want to use advanaced Delta features like Delta Live Tables,Z-order**  | Delta Lake  |

---

## Final Recommendation for Your Scenario (If Databricks is Main Engine)
If we are going with Azure Databricks and Medallion Architecture, Delta Lake is the natural fit because:
* Tight integration with Databricks runtime.
* Easy schema enforcement, schema evolution.
* Built-in ACID and time travel.
* Native integration with Unity Catalog for security/governance.
* Optimized query performance.
* Managed infrastructure (you don’t have to set up Iceberg catalog, metastore, etc.).


However, if in the future we want a more open, multi-engine architecture, and especially if you're integrating with Trino/Presto/Flink, Iceberg is a great candidate to consider — but requires more setup and is less mature in Azure as of now.

## Summary

| Criteria   |Delta Lake  | Apace Iceberg   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Best for Databricks on Azure**  | Yes   | Not Optimal(Yet)   |
| **Multi-cloud,Multi-engine**  | Limited (Getting Better)  | Strong   |
| **Vendor lock-in**  | More tied to Databricks  | Vendor Neutral   |
| **Advanced Features (DLT,Unity Catalog)**  |Supported  | Not Fully Available   |
| **Performance Optimizations**  |Highly Optimized |Depends on Engine   |
