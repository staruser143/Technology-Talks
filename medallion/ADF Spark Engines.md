Great point! You're right to bring up Azure Data Factory (ADF) in this conversation because ADF is often used in data engineering pipelines. But let's clarify what ADF is, what it's good at, and how it relates to Spark — including whether or not it "runs" Spark itself.


---

1. What is Azure Data Factory (ADF)?

ADF is primarily a cloud-based data integration (ETL/ELT) service.

It helps orchestrate and automate data movement, transformation, and workflows between data stores.

Think of ADF as a pipeline orchestrator and transformer — but it is not a Spark engine itself.



---

2. Can ADF Run Spark?

ADF by itself does NOT run Spark directly, but it can orchestrate Spark jobs on services that do run Spark.

Here are ways ADF interacts with Spark-based engines:

> So, ADF is the orchestrator, while the actual Spark computation happens on Databricks, Synapse, or HDInsight.

3. Role of ADF in Data Workflows

a. Orchestration & Scheduling

Manage complex data workflows involving multiple systems and stages.

Schedule Spark jobs along with data ingestion, transformation, and movement tasks.


b. Data Movement (Copy Activity)

Move data into/out of ADLS Gen2, SQL DB, Cosmos DB, Blob, etc..


c. Parameterization and Dynamic Pipelines

Build parameterized, reusable pipelines for Spark job execution across different datasets.


d. Monitoring and Error Handling

Centralized monitoring of pipelines including Spark job success/failure status.

4. Scenarios: Where Does ADF Fit with Spark?


---

5. Why Not Use ADF Alone for Heavy Data Engineering?

ADF Mapping Data Flows (GUI-based transformations) do NOT use Spark — they are based on Azure’s internal execution engine, not Apache Spark.

For heavy, custom transformations, machine learning, or Delta Lake operations, ADF Mapping Data Flows are not enough — you’ll need real Spark jobs via Databricks or Synapse Spark.

6. ADF Mapping Data Flows vs. Spark Jobs


---

7. So, When to Use ADF + Spark?

When you need orchestration around Spark jobs (e.g., move data, then process with Spark, then notify).

When you are using Synapse or Databricks for Spark but need pipeline control.

When running Spark alone isn’t sufficient — and the workflow spans multiple systems (SQL, NoSQL, Blob, API).

8. Visual of Flow Example

ADF Pipeline:
    |
    +--> Data ingestion (Copy Activity from external source to ADLS Gen2)
    |
    +--> Trigger Databricks Spark Job (e.g., Bronze → Silver transformation using Delta)
    |
    +--> Trigger Databricks Spark Job (Silver → Gold aggregation and curation)
    |
    +--> Load curated Gold data into Synapse SQL for BI/Reporting
    |
    +--> Notification (email, webhook) on completion

9. Final Answer - Recap

ADF doesn't run Spark natively — but it can orchestrate Spark jobs on Databricks, Synapse Spark, or HDInsight Spark.

ADF is excellent for orchestration, data movement, workflow automation — but heavy Spark-based data engineering is better done in Databricks or Synapse Spark.

If Delta Lake, ACID, machine learning, high performance Spark, and unified governance are critical — Databricks + Delta Lake is superior, and ADF can be used alongside for orchestration.
