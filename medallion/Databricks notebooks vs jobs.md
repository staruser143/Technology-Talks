Great call! Here's a clear textual flowchart/decision guide to help you decide between Databricks Notebooks vs. Databricks Jobs in a structured way:


---

Decision Flowchart (Text Format):

Step 1: Are you in a development or exploration phase?

Yes → Use Databricks Notebooks
(Reason: Notebooks are great for interactive data exploration, prototyping, and testing logic).

No → Go to Step 2.



---

Step 2: Is this process meant to run automatically on a schedule or as part of a pipeline?

Yes → Use Databricks Jobs
(Reason: Jobs support scheduling, automation, error handling, and monitoring).

No → Go to Step 3.



---

Step 3: Do you need to interactively analyze, visualize, or tweak code while running?

Yes → Use Databricks Notebooks
(Reason: Notebooks allow running code in cells, visualizing results, and making iterative changes).

No → Go to Step 4.



---

Step 4: Do you need robust error handling, retries, notifications, and dependencies between multiple tasks?

Yes → Use Databricks Jobs (with multi-task jobs)
(Reason: Jobs offer full production-grade orchestration features like retries, alerts, and task dependencies).

No → If still unclear, consider:

For ad-hoc data runs: Notebook

For consistent, repeatable production runs: Job
