Absolutely! You are spot on — this is actually a very common pattern in Databricks!

Summary of Pattern:

Use Notebooks for development, prototyping, and testing.

Once finalized, run the same Notebook as a Job for production execution — without rewriting as scripts or other formats.



---

Detailed Explanation:

1. Development Phase:

Databricks Notebooks are used for:

Writing and testing ETL/ELT logic.

Data exploration and visualization.

Developing and testing ML models.

Quick iteration and collaboration.



> Example:
You develop a Notebook that transforms raw customer data into a curated view. You test it interactively.




---

2. Production Phase:

Once the logic is ready and tested, the same Notebook can be linked to a Databricks Job.

The Job will:

Run the notebook automatically.

Accept parameters for dynamic behavior (if needed).

Handle scheduling, retries, failure handling, and alerts.



> Example:
You create a Databricks Job that runs the customer transformation notebook every night, with parameters like run_date, environment, etc.

4. Example Flow:

+-------------------+            +------------------+            +------------------------+
|   Develop Notebook |  ----->   |  Test Interactively|  ----->   |  Create Databricks Job  |
+-------------------+            +------------------+            +------------------------+
                                                                         |
                                                                         v
                                                     +-----------------------------------+
                                                     |  Schedule, Monitor, Auto-run       |
                                                     +-----------------------------------+

5. Best Practices:

Use Widgets for parameters when developing so they can be overridden during job runs:

dbutils.widgets.text("run_date", "2025-01-01", "Run Date")
run_date = dbutils.widgets.get("run_date")

Keep side-effect operations (writes/updates) under parameter flags to prevent accidental runs during development.

Add logging and error handling to make notebooks production-ready.

Use version control (Git) for notebook versioning and tracking.



---

Conclusion:

Yes, use notebooks for development.

Yes, run the same notebooks as production jobs.

This way, you get fast development and stable, production-ready deployments — without duplicating code.
