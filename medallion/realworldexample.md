Absolutely! Here's a real-world example of applying Medallion Architecture in an insurance domain for claims processing and analytics:


---

Scenario: Insurance Claims Analytics Platform

Problem:

An insurance company wants to build a data platform that can:

Ingest raw claims data from multiple sources (e.g., claims management system, third-party adjusters, IoT devices, partner APIs).

Clean, validate, and enrich this data.

Provide actionable insights to various teams (claims adjusters, fraud detection, actuarial teams, executives).



---

Applying Medallion Architecture:

1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

Data Sources:

Claims submitted via internal systems (CSV, JSON).

Third-party adjuster reports (Excel, PDFs converted to structured data).

IoT data (e.g., telematics data from vehicles).

APIs for partner data (e.g., healthcare providers, repair shops).


Storage Example:

/bronze/claims/2025/03/14/claims_batch_1.json
/bronze/adjuster_reports/2025/03/14/report_1.xlsx
/bronze/iot/2025/03/14/telematics_data_1.csv

Characteristics:

Stored as-is, no transformations.

Used for auditing and reprocessing in case of pipeline failure.

Supports schema evolution for new data formats.




---

2. Silver Layer (Cleaned and Enriched Data)

Processing Steps:

Data validation (e.g., mandatory fields like claim_id, policy_id).

Deduplication (e.g., removing duplicate claims).

Type casting (e.g., claim amount as decimal).

Enriching claims with customer data (joining with policyholder database).

Flagging missing information for review.


Example Table/View:

/silver/claims/processed_claims.parquet
/silver/adjuster_reports/cleaned_reports.parquet
/silver/iot/processed_telematics.parquet

Characteristics:

Clean, validated, enriched data.

Used for generating reports and feeding downstream applications like fraud detection models.




---

3. Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data for Analytics)

Aggregations and Modeling:

Total claims by region, type, and adjuster.

Average claim settlement time.

Fraud risk scoring (using Silver + ML models).

High-risk claims flagged for audit.


Example Table/View:

/gold/claims/claims_summary.parquet
/gold/claims/claims_fraud_risk.parquet
/gold/analytics/claim_adjuster_performance.parquet

Consumers:

Claims adjusters to prioritize high-value or high-risk claims.

Fraud detection teams to investigate suspicious claims.

Executives for KPIs and trend analysis via Power BI/Tableau dashboards.




---

Benefits Achieved:

Traceability: Ability to trace every Gold-level insight back to raw data.

Data Quality: Improved as data flows from Bronze → Silver → Gold.

Performance: Aggregated and optimized datasets in Gold for fast querying.

Flexibility: Ability to handle new claim types or adjuster formats by updating Bronze/Silver layers without disrupting Gold consumers.

Audit and Compliance: Retain raw data for regulatory audits.



---

Summary Flow:

Raw Claims Data (APIs, files, IoT) --> [Bronze] --> 
Clean, Enriched Claims Data (validated, joined) --> [Silver] --> 
Business Insights (KPIs, risk scores, dashboards) --> [Gold]

If you'd like, I can also share a diagram of this flow or how this could be implemented in a tech stack like Databricks with Delta Lake, AWS Glue/S3, or Azure Data Lake with Synapse. Let me know!
