## What is Medallion Architecture?
Medallion Architecture (also known as Multi-Hop Architecture) is a data lakehouse design pattern that organizes data into different layers or "medallions" — typically Bronze, Silver, and Gold — to improve data quality, manageability, and performance across the data lifecycle.

# Layers in Medallion Architecture:


|       | Purpose  | Characteristics   | Usage   |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)** | Ingest raw data from various sources (e.g., databases, logs, streaming data).  | Data is stored as-is, without much transformation.High voume, low quality, schema may evolve.   | Audit, traceability, replay for new processing   |
| **Silver Layer (Cleaned and Enriched Data)** | Clean, filter, and join datasets from Bronze to create refined datasets.   | Handles data quality, type casting, de-uplication. Schema enforced. Ready for downstream analytics, but not fully modeled.   | Used for creating data marts, aggregates, machine learning features   |
| **Gold Layer (Business-Level Data)** | Aggregate, summarize, and model data for business consumption   | Highly curated datasets.Optimized for reporting and analytics.   | Used directly in dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics   |

1. When dealing with large-scale data lakes or lakehouses:

Enables systematic processing and layering of data for improved governance and efficiency.



2. For data that comes from multiple, complex, or semi-structured sources:

Allows raw data to be ingested first, then incrementally processed.



3. When data quality and auditability are important:

Raw data in Bronze layer ensures you always have an unmodified copy.

Silver and Gold layers ensure progressive refinement and quality assurance.



4. When you need to serve diverse use cases:

Data scientists (may use Silver), business analysts (may use Gold), and engineers (may use Bronze).



5. For optimizing performance and cost in data processing pipelines:

Avoids reprocessing raw data for every use case by reusing Silver and Gold datasets.

Benefits of Medallion Architecture:

Scalability: Easily accommodates growing and evolving datasets.

Separation of concerns: Each layer has a clear purpose and ownership.

Data quality improvement: Progressive data cleaning and enrichment.

Reusability: Intermediate layers (Silver) can serve multiple downstream processes.

Cost-effectiveness: Optimizes storage and processing costs.

When Not to Use?

For small, simple datasets with straightforward transformations.

If low latency or real-time data needs are the only priority (though can be adapted for streaming with Delta Live Tables or similar tech).

When a fully structured and predefined schema is always ensured upstream (e.g., data warehouse-centric systems).
