# Summary of Pattern:

* Use Notebooks for development, prototyping, and testing.
* Once finalized, run the same Notebook as a Job for production execution — without rewriting as scripts or other formats.


# Detailed Explanation:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Development Phase:</th>
    <td><b>Databricks Notebooks</b> are used for:
<ul>
  <li>Writing and testing ETL/ELT logic.</li>
  <li>Data exploration and visualization.</li>
  <li>Developing and testing ML models.</li>
  <li>Quick iteration and collaboration..</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Example:</b>
  You develop a Notebook that transforms raw customer data into a curated view and test it interactively.

 <tr>
    <th>Production Phase:</th>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Once the logic is ready and tested, <b>the same Notebook can be linked to a Databricks Job</b>.</li>
        <li> The Job Will: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Run the notebook automatically.</li>
          <li>Accept parameters for dynamic behavior (if needed).</li>
          <li>Handle scheduling, retries, failure handling, and alerts.</li>
        </ul>
     </ul>
      <b>Example:</b>
      You create a Databricks Job that runs the customer transformation notebook every night, with parameters like run_date, environment, etc.

## Why This Pattern is Useful:

| Aspect     |Benefit                 |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Reusability**  | Develop Once, Reuse in production without changes   |
| **Seamless Promotion to Prod**  | Move from test to prod simply by creating a job   |
| **Rapid Prototyping to Production**  | No Need to rewrite or convert code |
| **Supports Parameters**  | Pass Runtime parameters to adjust behaviour|
| **Monitoring & Automation**  | Leverage Databricks job for production control |



##  Example Flow:

```
+-------------------+            +------------------+            +------------------------+
|   Develop Notebook |  ----->   |  Test Interactively|  ----->   |  Create Databricks Job  |
+-------------------+            +------------------+            +------------------------+
                                                                         |
                                                                         v
                                                     +-----------------------------------+
                                                     |  Schedule, Monitor, Auto-run       |
                                                     +-----------------------------------+


```
## Best Practices:

* Use Widgets for parameters when developing so they can be overridden during job runs:

```
dbutils.widgets.text("run_date", "2025-01-01", "Run Date")
run_date = dbutils.widgets.get("run_date")
```

* Keep side-effect operations (writes/updates) under parameter flags to prevent accidental runs during development.
* Add logging and error handling to make notebooks production-ready.
* Use version control (Git) for notebook versioning and tracking.

## Summary

* Yes, use notebooks for development.
* Yes, run the same notebooks as production jobs.
* This way, you get fast development and stable, production-ready deployments — without duplicating code.
