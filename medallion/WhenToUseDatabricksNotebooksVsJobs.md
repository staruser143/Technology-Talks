# When to use Databricks Notebooks vs Databricks Jobs
* Understanding the difference between Databricks Notebooks and Jobs is key to choosing the right tool depending on the scenario.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Databricks Notebooks
### What are Notebooks?
* Interactive development environments inside Databricks.
* Web-based, supporting multiple languages like Python, SQL, Scala, R.
* Used for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, collaborative development, and ML model development.
* Can run code cell by cell, visualize data inline, and iterate interactively.
* Supports version control via Git integration.


### Typical Use Cases:
|Scenario   | Why Notebook?  |
|------------|------------|
| Data Exploration & Profiling  | Interactive Analysis, Visualizations  |
| Model Development & Tuning  | Iterative Coding & Experimentation   |
| Ad-hoc Queries & troubleshooting  |Run specific parts of code on-demand  |
| Team Colloboration on code/data Insights  |Commenting , Sharing Notebooks  |
| Developing & Testing Transformtion Logic  |Before Moving to Production Pipelines  |

### Pros of Notebooks:
* Highly interactive.
* Built-in visualization.
* Easy to prototype and share.
* Supports multiple languages in the same environment.

### Databricks Jobs

#### What are Jobs?
* Automated, production-grade executions of Notebooks, JAR, Python scripts, or Spark Submit tasks.
* Used to schedule, orchestrate, and monitor data workflows.
* Supports parameter passing, dependencies, and retries.
* Integrated alerting, logging, and notifications for monitoring runs.
* Can be chained together for complex pipelines (multi-task jobs).


#### Typical Use Cases:

### Pros of Jobs:
* Automated and scheduled (no manual intervention).
* Robust monitoring and alerting.
* Supports retries, timeouts, and SLA enforcement.
* Multi-step workflow orchestration.
* Handles production-grade workloads.

5. Summary Recommendation

Use Notebooks when:

You are exploring, prototyping, developing.

You need interactive visualization.

Collaboration and experimentation are ongoing.


Use Jobs when:

You want to operationalize your notebook or code.

You need regular, automated, and monitored execution.

You want production-grade pipeline orchestration.
