### ADF and Databricks
* Azure Data Factory (ADF) can leverage Databricks as an activity within its pipelines to run complex data transformations and machine learning workloads, especially when Spark-based distributed processing is required.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how ADF integrates with Databricks and how this flow works in pipeline execution:


## How ADF Leverages Databricks in Pipelines

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Databricks Notebook/Job as an ADF Activity</th>
    <td>ADF allows you to invoke Databricks notebooks or jobs directly as part of a pipeline.You can orchestrate Databricks workflows using ADF "Azure Databricks" activity within a pipeline.</td>
  
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Authentication & Connection</th>
    <td>ADF uses a Linked Service to connect to Databricks.Authentication options:Access Token (Personal Access Token from Databricks),Managed Identity (for tighter Azure security integration)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Passing Parameters</th>
    <td>ADF can pass input parameters to Databricks notebooks (e.g., file paths, configuration settings).Results can be passed back or stored in a shared data lake (e.g., ADLS Gen2).</td>

  </tr>
</table>

### Common Pipeline Flow Using Databricks
<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Ingest Raw Data:</th>
    <td>Use ADF Copy Activity to move raw data into Bronze layer (ADLS Gen2).</td>
 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Transform Data using Databricks (Spark):</th>
    <td>Databricks Notebook/Job activity called by ADF to run complex transformations on raw data.Store processed data into Silver layer (cleaned, transformed data in Delta/Parquet format).</td>
 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Further Aggregations/ML (Optional):</th>
    <td>Call another Databricks Notebook for additional aggregations or ML model scoring.Results stored in Gold layer (aggregated, business-ready datasets).</td>

  </tr>
   <tr>
    <th> Load to Synapse/SQL/Power BI::</th>
    <td>ADF Copy Activity to move final datasets to Synapse for SQL queries or direct to Power BI datasets.
</td>

  </tr>
</table>

### Benefits of Using ADF + Databricks Together

| Feature/Requirement  | ADF   | Databricks   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Orchestration/Workflow**  | YES  | Limited( Jobs,Workflows)   |
| **Spark Based Transformations**  | NO   | YES (Fully Optimized |
| **Machine Learning/AI**  | NO (Direct)   | YES (MLib, Custom Models)  |
| **Parameter passing between activities**  | YES   | YES (When Invoked via MLib)  |
| **Event/Trigger based execution**  | YES(Schedule, event-based)  | Limited to Databricks jobs  |
| **Secure Connection to Azure Storage**  | YES   | YES (Direct access or via ADF |
| **Monitoring & Retry Logic**  | YES   | Basic Monitoring in Databricks |

### Example Use Cases for ADF + Databricks Integration
* Batch ETL pipelines that require Spark-based heavy lifting.
* Data cleansing and enrichment using Databricks, orchestrated via ADF.
* Running machine learning models (training or batch scoring) within a larger ADF data pipeline.
* Bronze-Silver-Gold pipeline orchestration using ADF to trigger Databricks notebooks.
* Event-driven processing where ADF listens to blob events and triggers Databricks for processing.

### When to Use ADF + Databricks Together?
| Scenario  | Recommendation     |
|------------|-------------|
| **Simple data copy/move jobs**  | ADF Only |
| **Complex transformations (big data, distributed**  | Databricks (or Databricks via ADF |
| **ML Training and Scoring in pipeline**  |  Databricks (Triggered by ADF|
| **Full Orchestration of End-to-end pipeline**  | ADF for Orchestration , Databricks for Compute |
| **Event Driven transformations with complex logic**  |  ADF Pipeline with Databricks step |


### Summary of ADF-Databricks Flow
1. **ADF pipeline starts** based on trigger/schedule.
2. **Copy raw data** into ADLS Gen2.
3. **Databricks activity runs** for transformation/ML.
4. **Write back results** to ADLS (Delta/Parquet).
5. **Further steps** (e.g., move data to Synapse or Power BI).
