Great question! A **Context Map Diagram** is a **strategic Domain-Driven Design (DDD) tool** that visually represents how different **Bounded Contexts** within a system — or across systems — relate to each other.

It doesn’t show technical architecture like servers or databases. Instead, it focuses on **how teams, models, and business domains interact**, including the nature of those relationships, integration patterns, and potential friction points.

## 🎯 Purpose of a Context Map

> “To make explicit the boundaries between models and the nature of their interactions — so teams can collaborate effectively without corrupting each other’s models.”

It helps answer:
- What are the major parts (Bounded Contexts) of our system?
- How do they communicate?
- Where are the risks of misunderstanding or coupling?
- Who owns what?
- Where do we need translation or isolation?

## 🧩 Core Elements of a Context Map Diagram

### 1. **Bounded Context (BC)**
> A logical boundary where a particular domain model is defined and applicable.

Represented as:  
🟦 **Box with name** — e.g., `Member Management`, `Claims Processing`, `Billing`

> Inside each box, you might include:
> - Key domain concepts (e.g., Member, Claim, Invoice)
> - Team name (optional)
> - Ubiquitous Language sample (optional)

---

### 2. **Relationships Between Contexts**

Each line connecting two BCs is labeled with a **context mapping pattern**, which describes the *nature* of the relationship.

#### Common DDD Context Mapping Patterns:

| Pattern                  | Description                                                                 | When to Use                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Partnership**          | Two teams/BCs collaborate closely and evolve models together.               | Shared ownership of a complex integration point. |
| **Shared Kernel**        | Teams share a subset of the model/codebase and coordinate changes.          | High coupling is acceptable (rare in microservices). |
| **Customer-Supplier**    | One BC (supplier) serves another (customer). Customer’s needs drive supplier. | Billing depends on Member Management for data.   |
| **Conformist**           | One BC adopts the model of another without negotiation (often downstream).  | Legacy system forces you to conform.             |
| **Anticorruption Layer (ACL)** | One BC uses a translation layer to avoid being corrupted by another’s model. | Integrating with external or legacy systems.     |
| **Open Host Service**    | A BC exposes a well-defined, versioned API for others to consume.           | When you want to encourage broad integration.    |
| **Published Language**   | BCs communicate using a shared language/schema (e.g., JSON Schema, Protobuf). | Event-driven systems, inter-org integrations.    |
| **Separate Ways**        | BCs are completely isolated — no integration.                               | When coupling is too costly or unnecessary.      |

                                   └──────────────────────┘
```

> 💡 In this example:
> - `Member Management` is the central hub.
> - `Billing` consumes events → **Published Language**.
> - `Legacy Claims` is protected via **ACL**.
> - `Benefits` is upstream supplier → **Customer/Supplier**.

## 🛠️ How to Create a Context Map

### Step 1: Identify Bounded Contexts
Workshop with domain experts. Ask:
> “Where do the models change meaning?”  
> “Where do teams have different vocabularies for the same thing?”

### Step 2: Identify Relationships
Ask:
> “Who consumes data from whom?”  
> “Is there a power imbalance? (e.g., legacy system dictating terms)”  
> “Do teams coordinate releases?”

### Step 3: Label with Patterns
Apply the most accurate DDD pattern to each relationship.

### Step 4: Visualize
Use:
- Whiteboard + sticky notes (great for workshops)
- Diagramming tools: **Miro**, **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, **Structurizr**, **PlantUML**

## 📌 PlantUML Example (Code-Based Diagram)

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Member Management" {
  [Member]
  [Dependent]
  [Enrollment]
}

package "Claims Processing" {
  [Claim]
  [Adjudication]
}

package "Billing" {
  [Invoice]
  [Payment]
}

package "Legacy System" {
  [OldClaimRecord]
}

Member Management --> Claims Processing : «ACL»\ntranslates to legacy format
Member Management --> Billing : «Published Language»\nMemberEnrolledEvent
Benefits --> Member Management : «Customer/Supplier»\nvalidates plan before enroll

@enduml
```

→ Renders as a clean, code-managed diagram.

## 🧭 Why Context Maps Matter in Healthcare Insurance

Healthcare systems are notorious for:
- Siloed teams (enrollment, claims, care, billing)
- Legacy mainframes with rigid interfaces
- Regulatory systems (CMS, HIX, EDI) dictating formats
- Mergers creating multiple models for “member” or “provider”

A Context Map:
✅ Prevents model pollution  
✅ Clarifies ownership  
✅ Guides integration strategy (ACL vs Events vs APIs)  
✅ Surfaces organizational friction  
✅ Helps prioritize refactoring (e.g., replace Conformist with ACL)

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

- ❌ Mapping technical layers (UI, API, DB) instead of business domains.
- ❌ Ignoring team/org boundaries — context maps reflect *social* structure too.
- ❌ Using vague arrows without patterns — “integrates with” is not enough.
- ❌ Making it static — context maps must evolve with strategy and org changes.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Co-create with domain experts and team leads.
- Keep it visible — print it and hang it in team areas.
- Revisit quarterly — especially after org changes or M&A.
- Use color coding: Core (red), Supporting (blue), Generic (gray).
- Annotate pain points: “ACL needed here”, “Team A blocked by Team B”.

---

## 🎁 Bonus: Context Map as a Collaboration Tool

Use it during:
- Onboarding — “Here’s how the system fits together.”
- Architecture reviews — “Is this coupling acceptable?”
- Incident post-mortems — “Did model corruption cause this bug?”
- Planning — “Should we merge these two contexts?”

## 💡 Want to See a Realistic Context Map for Your Member Management BC?

I can generate a **customized Context Map diagram** (in text or PlantUML) based on:
- Your system’s other Bounded Contexts
- Integration points (EDI, CMS, Pharmacy, etc.)
- Legacy or third-party systems

Just describe your landscape — and I’ll map it out!

✅ **In short**: A Context Map is your DDD compass — it shows you where the boundaries are, who speaks what language, and how to navigate between domains without getting lost or corrupted.
