The options for making ingested transactional data available to analytical data stores depend on the initial ingestion choice (Cloud Storage, Cloud Data Store, or Hybrid) and the speed requirements (batch or real-time/near real-time).

The general process is often described by the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** or **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** pattern, which are the primary mechanisms for moving data from a raw source to a refined analytical destination.

## 1. Cloud Storage (S3/ADLS) $\rightarrow$ Analytics

When data lands in Cloud Storage (the Data Lake), you use an **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** approach. The storage is the source of all raw data.

| Analytical Data Store | Mechanism (ELT Tools) | Speed & Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Data Warehouse** (e.g., Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics) | **ETL/ELT Services** (AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, Databricks) | **Batch Processing:** Scheduled jobs read large volumes of files (Parquet/Delta/ORC) from S3/ADLS, run complex joins and transformations, and load the aggregated results into the Data Warehouse. This is ideal for historical reporting and BI dashboards. |
| **Serverless Query Engine** (e.g., Amazon Athena, Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pool) | **External Table Definitions** (AWS Glue Data Catalog, Azure Purview) | **Interactive Query:** Define a **schema-on-read** over the data files in storage. Analysts can run standard SQL queries directly against the files in S3/ADLS without loading them first. This is fast for ad-hoc, exploratory analytics. |
| **Data Lakehouse** (e.g., Databricks Delta Lake) | **Databricks/Spark Notebooks** | **Hybrid:** Uses the files in S3/ADLS but adds transaction support and schema enforcement. Data is progressively refined (Bronze $\rightarrow$ Silver $\rightarrow$ Gold) within the lake, and the Gold tables become the analytical data store. |

## 2. Cloud Data Store (RDS/Cosmos DB) $\rightarrow$ Analytics

When data first lands in an operational database (a transactional system), you typically use **Change Data Capture (CDC)** or **Log-Based Replication**. This is essential to move data without impacting the performance of the live transactional system.

| Analytical Data Store | Mechanism (CDC Tools) | Speed & Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Data Warehouse** (e.g., Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics) | **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** or **Azure Data Factory CDC** | **Batch/Near Real-Time:** CDC extracts incremental changes (inserts, updates, deletes) from the transactional database's log and delivers them to the Data Warehouse. This keeps the analytical store synchronized with the operational one. |
| **Data Stream/Queue** (e.g., Kinesis, Event Hubs) | **Native CDC Connectors** (e.g., Debezium, specific database services) | **Real-Time Analytics:** Captures every database change event as a stream and routes it to a stream processing engine (like Kinesis Data Analytics or Azure Stream Analytics). This enables **real-time alerting** or instant updates to an operational dashboard. |

## 3. Hybrid Architecture Options

The most advanced and modern approach combines the best of both worlds, often forming a **Lakehouse Architecture** or **Data Mesh**.

| Architectural Pattern | How it Works | Analytical Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Database $\rightarrow$ Data Lake (Near Real-Time)** | Utilizes **Zero-ETL Integrations** (e.g., Amazon RDS to Redshift integration) or **CDC to Cloud Storage**. | Operational data becomes instantly available in the Data Lake's format. You unify all analytical data in one place, enabling a **"Patient 360"** view that combines transactional and historical data. |
| **Federated Query** | Analytical tools (e.g., Redshift or Synapse) are configured to query the analytical data store **AND** the operational database/Cloud Storage **simultaneously** using a single query. | Analysts can combine historical trends (from the Data Warehouse) with the absolute latest transactional data (from the operational DB) without needing to fully replicate the entire database. |
| **Lambda/Kappa Architecture** | **Lambda:** Uses a **"Hot Path"** (Streaming data to a real-time store) and a **"Cold Path"** (Batch data to the Data Warehouse), merging the results at the final consumption layer. **Kappa:** Simplifies this by treating all data as a stream, processing it in real-time and writing both the raw and processed results to storage. | Provides **low-latency insights** (from the stream) and **high-accuracy, comprehensive insights** (from the batch). |
