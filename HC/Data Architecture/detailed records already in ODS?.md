# query 
Aren't detailed records already available in operational/transactional data stores and copying them again to data warehouses like Redshift could result in increased storage costs and ETL costs. How is this justified?

# response
That's an excellent and crucial point, as **storage cost** and **ETL complexity** are the primary drawbacks of using a separate data warehouse. However, the cost is justified by the massive savings and business value realized through **analytic performance** and **operational stability**.

Here's the justification for storing detailed records in a data warehouse like Redshift:

***

## 1. Cost & Performance Justification (The Crux)

The core justification is that **analytics are vastly cheaper to run on a data warehouse than on an operational database.**

| Metric | Operational DB (RDS/DocumentDB) | Data Warehouse (Redshift) | Benefit of Redshift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Analytic Query** | **Extremely High** | **Low to Moderate** | Redshift's Columnar/MPP architecture processes complex queries faster, drastically reducing the **Compute Time Cost** per query. |
| **Performance Impact** | **Severe:** Long-running queries can **lock tables**, slow down applications, and even cause the transactional database to crash. | **Zero Impact** on the operational system. | **Protects the business** by keeping the live enrollment application fast and available 24/7. |
| **Storage Efficiency** | **Low:** Uses **row-based storage** and is designed for rapid updates (less compression). | **High:** Uses **columnar storage** and advanced compression techniques, often reducing the actual storage footprint by **5x to 10x** compared to row-based storage. | The effective storage cost per GB of data is often **lower** in Redshift than in a high-performance transactional DB. |

In short, you pay for ETL and extra storage, but you **save much more** on analytical compute time and prevent the **catastrophic cost** of application downtime or slow transactions.

## 2. Data Integration and Consistency

Transactional databases store data optimized for a **single application** (e.g., the enrollment system). The data warehouse stores data optimized for **the entire business**.

* **Integration:** The Redshift copy is the **unified view** of data, combining enrollment records (from RDS), web clicks (from Cloud Storage), and customer support logs (from a separate DocumentDB/SaaS tool). Analyzing these three sources together is impossible in the individual operational stores.
* **Data Quality (The "T" in ETL/ELT):** The data copied to Redshift is **cleaned, standardized, and transformed**.
    * *Example:* Enrollment status might be 'A', 'a', or 'Active' in three different source systems. The ETL process cleans this to a single value, 'Active', ensuring all dashboards and reports are consistent and accurate. Operational systems don't perform this cross-system cleaning.

## 3. Historical Data and Schema Flexibility

Operational databases are only designed to hold **current, active data**.

* **Historical Requirements:** Enrollment applications from five years ago might be archived or deleted from the live RDS to maintain performance. The data warehouse **must** keep all historical data to analyze year-over-year trends and forecast future enrollment.
* **Auditing and Compliance:** The data warehouse serves as the **immutable audit trail** of historical facts, which is critical for regulatory compliance (e.g., verifying a member's eligibility or coverage details from a past plan year).

Therefore, the investment in **ETL/ELT and duplicate storage** is a necessary trade-off to enable **fast, accurate, protected, and comprehensive strategic analysis** that the live transactional systems are simply not built to deliver.
