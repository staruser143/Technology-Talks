# Query
For an enrollment system based on CQRS and event sourcing if we use an event store collection to store all the raw events and an event processor which processes each of the raw events and stores them to a corresponding, should we consider copying the event records , domain records or both of them to datawarehouses like Redshift.

# Response
For an enrollment system using CQRS and Event Sourcing, the optimal approach is to copy **both** the raw **Event Records** and the **Domain Records** (the Materialized Read Models) to the data warehouse like Redshift, but for different purposes.

Here is a breakdown of what each data type provides and why both are necessary in the analytical data store:

---

## 1. Event Records (The "Why" and "What Happened")

The raw event records from the Event Store are your most valuable analytical asset and should always be copied to the data warehouse.

* **What they are:** Immutable, chronological records of every change that ever occurred (e.g., `EnrollmentCreated`, `PlanUpdated`, `PaymentProcessed`).
* **Why copy them to Redshift:**
    * **Historical Audit/Forensics:** They are the *complete* audit trail, necessary for regulatory compliance and forensic analysis. If a business insight seems wrong, you can trace the analysis back to the exact sequence of events.
    * **Re-analysis and New Insights:** The raw events allow you to ask fundamentally new questions that were not considered when the read models were initially designed. For example, you can calculate the average time between `ApplicationSubmitted` and `ApplicationApproved`â€”a metric only possible by analyzing the event stream.
    * **Machine Learning (ML):** Events provide the fine-grained sequence of actions required for advanced ML models, such as predicting customer churn or optimizing the sales funnel based on behavioral patterns.

---

## 2. Domain Records / Read Models (The "Current State")

The Domain Records, which are the materialized views (the 'R' in CQRS) created by your event processor, should also be copied.

* **What they are:** The **current state** of the entity, optimized for fast lookups. For an enrollment system, this would be the current `Policy` table, `Member` table, or `Group` table that the application uses for reading.
* **Why copy them to Redshift:**
    * **Current Reporting (BI):** They provide the simplest way to answer **current state** business questions: *"How many active policies do we have right now?"* or *"What is the current premium amount for Customer X?"* This is the data used to power most real-time operational dashboards.
    * **Contextualization and Joins:** They provide easy **context** for the events. When analyzing an `EnrollmentCancelled` event, you need to quickly join it with the *current* `Agent` record to attribute the cancellation, which is much faster using the materialized domain table.
    * **Simplicity for Analysts:** Business Intelligence (BI) tools and analysts are usually more comfortable working with standard, current-state relational tables than complex event streams.

## Conclusion: The Combined Approach

By copying **both** data sets into the data warehouse, you create a powerful analytic environment:

1.  **Event Records (The Fact Table):** Serve as the **detailed, historical fact data** for deep, complex, time-series analysis.
2.  **Domain Records (The Dimension Table):** Serve as the **slowly changing dimensions** providing the current, simple context necessary for BI reporting and efficient lookups.

This combined strategy ensures that the data warehouse can support both high-speed, current-state BI dashboards **and** deep, future-proof historical analysis.
