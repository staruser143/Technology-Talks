Does that mean the ETL processes  now have a new destination to extract data from multiple operational data stores ,which is cloud storage. If so, how could we design then and what options are there for them in aws/azure clouds.

# response
That is exactly right. The shift to the Datalakehouse architecture fundamentally changes the **extraction (E)** and **loading (L)** parts of the process.

The new destination for the raw data is indeed the **Cloud Storage** (S3 in AWS, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Azure), which acts as the unified landing zone. The process flips from **ETL** (Extract $\rightarrow$ Transform $\rightarrow$ Load) to **ELT** (Extract $\rightarrow$ Load $\rightarrow$ Transform).

Here is how you design the modern **ELT pipeline** and the common AWS/Azure options.

## The Modern ELT Process Design

In a Datalakehouse, the focus is on getting the raw data into the cheap, central storage as quickly as possible, and then transforming it *in place* using scalable compute services. This is often modeled using the **Medallion Architecture**, which defines three logical layers within the cloud storage:

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Data State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st** | **Bronze (Raw Zone)** | **Load.** Ingest data with minimal cleanup. This is the immutable, raw copy from the source systems. | Raw, Source Format (CSV, JSON, XML). |
| **2nd** | **Silver (Staging/Clean Zone)** | **Clean & Conform.** Apply quality checks, handle schema enforcement, and map source keys to **Conformed Dimensions** (the step necessary to merge data from multiple sources). | Cleaned, Structured (often Parquet/Delta Lake). |
| **3rd** | **Gold (Consumption Zone)** | **Model & Aggregate.** Apply dimensional modeling (Star Schema) and build aggregate tables for immediate BI consumption. | Highly-refined, Denormalized, BI-ready tables. |

The Cloud Storage (S3/ADLS) is the destination for *all three* layers. The ETL/ELT process orchestrates the movement and transformation *between* these logical layers.

## Cloud Options for the ELT Pipeline

The tools you choose must be able to read and write to the Cloud Storage layer efficiently and handle the scale of transformation required by the Datalakehouse.

### A. AWS Options (S3 & Redshift-centric)

AWS offers a few powerful, distinct services to handle different parts of the ELT process:

1.  **Ingestion (E & L - to Bronze Layer):**
    * **AWS Data Migration Service (DMS):** Best for extracting data from operational databases (like RDS) via Change Data Capture (CDC) and streaming it continuously to S3.
    * **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose:** Best for streaming data (logs, IoT events) directly to S3.

2.  **Transformation (T - Bronze $\rightarrow$ Silver $\rightarrow$ Gold):**
    * **AWS Glue (Serverless):** The primary serverless ETL/ELT service. It uses **Apache Spark** under the hood, making it highly scalable for running transformation jobs directly on data stored in S3. It registers the schema in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**, which is essential for defining the tables in the Silver and Gold layers.
    * **Redshift Spectrum / Redshift ELT:** For advanced users, **Redshift** itself can be used to query and transform data directly in S3 using its processing power (ELT).

3.  **Orchestration:**
    * **AWS Step Functions:** Used to sequence and manage the flow of Glue jobs, DMS tasks, and data quality checks.

### B. Azure Options (ADLS Gen2 & Synapse-centric)

Azure offers a highly integrated, unified platform approach focused on Azure Synapse Analytics:

1.  **Ingestion (E & L - to Bronze Layer):**
    * **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** The main ETL/ELT orchestration tool. It's used to copy data from various sources (databases, SaaS APIs) into **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)**.
    * **Azure Event Hubs/IoT Hub:** Used for real-time streaming ingestion into ADLS.

2.  **Transformation (T - Bronze $\rightarrow$ Silver $\rightarrow$ Gold):**
    * **Azure Synapse Analytics:** This is a comprehensive service that provides multiple transformation engines over ADLS:
        * **Synapse Spark Pools:** Highly scalable Apache Spark environments for complex data engineering (like AWS Glue).
        * **Synapse Serverless SQL Pool:** Allows SQL queries to run directly on the data files in ADLS Gen2 (similar to Redshift Spectrum/Athena), which is perfect for ad-hoc analysis and defining the Gold layer views.

3.  **Orchestration:**
    * **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Used to build and schedule the entire ELT pipeline, including data ingestion and running Synapse Spark jobs.

The key takeaway is that you are no longer constrained by the Data Warehouse's processing power during the initial load; you are leveraging the immense, cost-effective storage of the cloud and the elastic compute of services like AWS Glue or Azure Synapse.
