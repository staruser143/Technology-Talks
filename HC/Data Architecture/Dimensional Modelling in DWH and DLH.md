Great question! The short answer is: **Dimensional modeling is strongly recommended—but not strictly required—in both data warehouse and data lakehouse architectures**, and its relevance depends on your **use cases, audience, and query patterns**.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔹 What Is Dimensional Modeling?

Dimensional modeling (popularized by Ralph Kimball) is a **design technique** for structuring data to support **fast, intuitive, and business-friendly analytics**. It uses:

- **Fact tables**: Contain measurable, quantitative business events (e.g., sales, clicks).
- **Dimension tables**: Provide descriptive context (e.g., customer, product, time).
- Common schemas: **Star schema** (denormalized dimensions) or **Snowflake schema** (normalized dimensions).

Its goal: **optimize for query performance and business understanding**, not storage efficiency.

### 🔹 In Traditional Data Warehouses: **Yes, Usually**

In classic **data warehouse (DWH)** environments (e.g., on-premises or cloud DWH like Redshift, Snowflake, Synapse SQL Pools):

✅ **Dimensional modeling is a best practice** because:
- BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) and business users expect **flat, denormalized views**.
- It enables **fast aggregations** over large fact tables with efficient joins to small dimension tables.
- It supports **consistent business metrics and definitions** (e.g., “What is a ‘customer’?”).
- Most ETL pipelines are designed around Kimball-style conformed dimensions.

> 📌 **Bottom line**: If your primary use case is **enterprise reporting, dashboards, or self-service BI**, dimensional modeling is highly valuable—even essential—in a data warehouse.

### 🔹 In Data Lakehouse: **Optional, but Still Useful**

In a **lakehouse** (e.g., Delta Lake on Databricks, Iceberg on AWS/Azure), you have more flexibility:

#### ✅ When to Use Dimensional Modeling in a Lakehouse:
- You still serve **BI users** and need **optimized reporting layers**.
- You want to **decouple raw data (bronze)** from **business-ready data (gold)**.
- You follow the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold), where the **Gold layer often uses star schemas**.
- You need **consistent KPIs** across departments (e.g., finance vs. marketing).

> Example: Store raw JSON logs in Bronze, clean/validate in Silver, and build a `fact_sales` + `dim_customer` star schema in Gold for Power BI.

#### 🚫 When You Might Skip It:
- Your primary users are **data scientists** running ML on raw or lightly processed data.
- You use **wide tables** or **nested semi-structured data** (e.g., Parquet with arrays/maps) that don’t fit star schemas.
- You rely on **on-the-fly transformations** (e.g., dbt models, Spark SQL views) instead of pre-built schemas.
- You prioritize **schema-on-read flexibility** over pre-modeled structures.

> 💡 Many lakehouses use **both**: raw/nested data for ML + dimensional models for BI.

### 🔸 Key Differences in Approach

| Aspect | Data Warehouse | Data Lakehouse |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Modeling Timing** | Schema-on-write (model early) | Schema-on-read or hybrid (model late or on-demand) |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible; changes require ETL redesign | More flexible; raw data preserved, models can evolve |
| **Layers** | Often single modeled layer | Multi-layer (raw → curated → semantic) |
| **Audience** | Primarily BI/reporting | BI + Data Science + ML + Streaming |

### 🔹 Modern Best Practice: **Use Dimensional Modeling Where It Adds Value**

Even in lakehouses, most mature organizations **still build dimensional models—but selectively**:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data (no modeling).
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, validated, lightly structured (may include conformed dimensions).
3. **Gold Layer**: Business-ready **star schemas** for reporting and dashboards.

This gives you:
- **Flexibility** for data science (access to raw/silver layers)
- **Performance & clarity** for BI (gold layer with dimensional models)

Tools like **dbt (data build tool)** make it easy to build and maintain dimensional models on top of lakehouse storage.

### ✅ Conclusion

- **Do you *need* dimensional modeling?**  
  → **No**, especially in a lakehouse where flexibility is key.

- **Should you use it?**  
  → **Yes, if you support BI, reporting, or business users**—in **both** data warehouses **and** lakehouses.

> Think of dimensional modeling not as a rigid requirement, but as a **powerful design pattern** for delivering **trusted, high-performance analytics**—wherever your architecture lives.

In short:  
> **Lakehouse ≠ No modeling.**  
> It means **model smarter, later, and only where needed.**
