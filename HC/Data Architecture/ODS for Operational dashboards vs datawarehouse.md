Couldn't we power real-time operational dashboards from domain data store collection itself, rather than datawarehouse which only has a copy of them. Also , we need to sync the datawarehouse too whenever we process the event stream from event store collection to domain data store collection. Seems they have overlapping features. If not, what would be the usage of domain data store collection.

# Response

That's a very insightful question that gets to the heart of the trade-offs in a CQRS/Event Sourcing architecture.

You are correct: **You *can* power real-time operational dashboards from the Domain Data Store (Read Model).** This is, in fact, the recommended use case for that collection.

However, the Domain Data Store and the Data Warehouse (Redshift) serve two **distinct and non-overlapping primary analytical purposes**, defined by the type of query they are optimized for.

Here is a breakdown of their primary usage and why both are necessary:

***

## 1. Domain Data Store (Read Model) Usage: OLTP Analytics

The Domain Data Store is designed for **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)**, but within a CQRS system, it is optimized for **high-velocity, current-state reads**.

| Usage Type | Primary Question | Why the Domain Store is Best |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Dashboards** | "What is the **current** status of policy X?" "How many applications were submitted **today**?" | It is near real-time, highly available, and optimized for fetching a **small number of current records** quickly. It supports the immediate needs of customer service or operations staff. |
| **Application Reads** | "Show me the policy details for customer ID 123." | This is its main purpose: serving the data required by the main application's user interface. |
| **Low Latency Lookups** | "Is this customer eligible for a discount right now?" | It's designed for sub-second, simple lookups that underpin operational decisions. |

***

## 2. Data Warehouse (Redshift) Usage: OLAP Analytics

The Data Warehouse is optimized for **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)**, focused on **historical trends and complex aggregation**.

| Usage Type | Primary Question | Why the Data Warehouse is Best |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic Business Intelligence** | "What is the **average premium trend** for new members aged 45-55 in the Northwest region over the **last five years**, and how does it correlate with marketing spend?" | It is optimized for **scanning and aggregating billions of rows** across years of historical data efficiently, without impacting the live application. |
| **Cross-Domain Joins** | "Combine enrollment data with web click data (from S3) and call center data (from CRM) to calculate customer lifetime value (CLV)." | It is built to integrate vast amounts of data from **disparate sources** into a unified, denormalized view. |
| **Deep Drill-Down & Ad-Hoc Analysis** | "Why did our retention rate drop last quarter?" (Requires querying all 100 million policies to find the root cause). | Its Columnar and MPP architecture handles long-running, CPU-intensive queries that would crash an operational store. |

## Why the Synchronization and Overlap are Justified

The overlapping features (both stores hold policy data) are a necessary design choice to prevent the wrong workload from running on the wrong system.

1.  **Protecting the Core System:** The most critical function of the separation is to ensure that a long-running, complex **BI query never slows down or breaks the operational system**. The "copy" in the data warehouse is the **sacrifice** that protects the live application.
2.  **Schema and Optimization:** The Domain Data Store is optimized for **writes and simple application reads** (normalized schema). The Data Warehouse is optimized for **complex, large-scale reads** (denormalized, columnar storage). They are structured for opposite purposes.
3.  **The ETL/ELT Sync:** The need to sync the data warehouse is a necessary overhead. In modern systems, this synchronization is often automated using **Change Data Capture (CDC)** or processing the event stream directly, minimizing the complexity and latency of the copy.

In summary, the Domain Data Store answers **"What is happening right now?"** for the application, while the Data Warehouse answers **"Why did it happen, and what does it mean for the future?"** for the business. They have distinct roles defined by the users and the complexity of the query.
