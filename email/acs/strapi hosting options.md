Strapi offers several **hosting options** depending on your scalability, security, and operational preferences. Here's a breakdown of the main choices:

---

## 🏗️ **1. Self-Hosted (Open Source Edition)**

### ✅ Best for:
- Full control over infrastructure
- Custom deployments (e.g., on-prem, private cloud)

### 🔧 Deployment Options:
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for portability
- **Kubernetes**: Scalable orchestration for production workloads
- **Cloud VMs**: Host on Azure, AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine
- **Bare Metal**: For on-premise or secure environments

### 🔐 Considerations:
- You manage updates, backups, scaling, and security
- Ideal for enterprise-grade customizations

---

## ☁️ **2. Strapi Cloud (Managed Hosting)**

### ✅ Best for:
- Quick setup and minimal DevOps
- Teams that want to focus on content, not infrastructure

### 🌐 Features:
- Fully managed by Strapi
- Auto-scaling, backups, monitoring
- Role-based access and team collaboration
- Git-based deployment workflows

### 💰 Pricing:
- Tiered plans based on usage, environments, and team size

## 🧩 **3. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Hosting**

You can deploy Strapi on platforms like:
- **Render**
- **Heroku**
- **Vercel** (via serverless functions)
- **Netlify** (with backend API hosted separately)

These platforms simplify deployment and CI/CD but may have limitations on long-running processes or storage.

---

## ☁️ **4. Cloud Provider Services**

You can host Strapi on:
- **Azure App Service**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk / ECS**
- **Google App Engine**

These offer more control than PaaS and integrate well with other cloud-native services (e.g., Blob Storage, Key Vault, IAM).

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Strapi supports **JWT-based authentication**, **RBAC**, and **custom policies**
- For compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), choose hosting that meets your regulatory needs (e.g., Azure India region for data residency)
