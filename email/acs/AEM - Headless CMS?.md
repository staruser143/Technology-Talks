Yes, **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)** can function as a **headless CMS**, although it is traditionally known as a full-featured **hybrid CMS**.

## ðŸ§  What Is a Headless CMS?

A **headless CMS** is a content management system that:
- Stores and manages content centrally
- Exposes content via **RESTful or GraphQL APIs**
- Does **not** dictate how or where the content is rendered (i.e., no front-end)

This allows developers to use any front-end technology (React, Angular, mobile apps, etc.) to consume and render content.

## ðŸ§© AEM as a Headless CMS

### âœ… **Capabilities**
- **Content Fragment Models**: Define structured content types (e.g., email templates, product info).
- **Content Fragments**: Reusable content blocks managed by business users.
- **AEM Headless APIs**:
  - **GraphQL API**: For querying content fragments
  - **REST API**: For accessing assets and page content
- **Decoupled Architecture**: You can use AEM purely for content authoring and serve content to any backend or frontend system.

### âœ… **Use Case for Email Templates**
- Business users create email templates as **content fragments**.
- Backend service (e.g., Node.js or Java) fetches the template via AEMâ€™s API.
- Dynamic data is injected using a templating engine.
- Final email is sent via **Azure Communication Services (ACS)**.
