Yes, **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** provides robust support for **email analytics and tracking**, including key performance metrics like **open rates**, **click-through rates**, and **bounce rates**. Here's how it works:

---

### ðŸ“Š **Email Engagement Tracking Features**

#### âœ… **1. Open and Click Tracking**
ACS allows you to enable **user engagement tracking** for verified custom domains:
- Tracks **email opens** and **link clicks**.
- Only works for **HTML-formatted emails** (not plaintext).
- Requires explicit opt-in and configuration in the ACS portal [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/email/enable-user-engagement-tracking).

To enable:
- Go to your ACS Email resource â†’ **Provision Domains** â†’ Select your domain â†’ **Turn On** engagement tracking.

### ðŸ“ˆ **2. Email Insights Dashboard**
ACS provides a built-in **Insights Dashboard** via **Azure Monitor Workbooks**:
- Visualizes metrics like:
  - Total emails sent
  - Delivered, failed, blocked
  - Opened and clicked
  - Bounce and suppression rates
- Supports filtering by date, recipient, and location [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/analytics/insights/email-insights).

You can customize dashboards or create new ones using **Log Analytics Workbooks**.

### ðŸ§¾ **3. Operational Logs for Deep Analysis**
ACS generates detailed logs that can be routed to:
- **Log Analytics**
- **Event Hubs**
- **Azure Storage**

Log categories include:
- **Send Mail Logs**: API usage, size, recipient counts
- **Delivery Status Logs**: Delivered, bounced, suppressed, spam-filtered
- **User Engagement Logs**: Open rates, click-throughs, unsubscribe events [3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/analytics/logs/email-logs)

These logs can be queried using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** for custom reporting and alerting.

---

### ðŸ”„ **Bounce and Suppression Tracking**
ACS tracks:
- **Hard Bounces** (permanent failures)
- **Soft Bounces** (temporary issues)
- **Suppressed Recipients** (opt-outs or invalid addresses)
- **Spam Filtering and Quarantine Events**

This helps you maintain sender reputation and optimize delivery strategies[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/analytics/logs/email-logs).
