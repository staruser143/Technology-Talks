Yes, **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** does support **bulk email sending**, and it's designed to scale for high-volume use cases. Here's a detailed overview of what you can do:

---

### âœ… **Bulk Email Support in ACS**

#### **1. High Scalability**
- ACS can handle **millions of emails per hour**.
- Internally, Microsoft has tested ACS with **up to 2 million emails/hour** [1](https://www.schneider.im/microsoft-azure-communication-services-handling-high-volume-email-traffic/).
- It automatically scales to accommodate spikes in email trafficâ€”no need to provision infrastructure manually.

#### **2. No Recipient Limits**
- Unlike Exchange Online (which limits external recipients to ~2,000/day), ACS has **no hard limits** on the number of recipients [1](https://www.schneider.im/microsoft-azure-communication-services-handling-high-volume-email-traffic/).
- Ideal for **marketing campaigns**, **transactional notifications**, and **system alerts**.

#### **3. SDK and API Support**
- SDKs available for **Java**, **.NET**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.
- You can send emails to multiple recipients using `To`, `CC`, and `BCC` fields in a single API call [2](https://mailtrap.io/blog/azure-send-email/).

#### **4. SMTP and REST API Options**
- Use **SMTP** for quick integration with existing tools.
- Use **REST APIs** or SDKs for programmatic control and automation.

#### **5. Monitoring and Analytics**
- Track delivery status, failures, and engagement.
- Integrate with **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics** for alerting and dashboards [1](https://www.schneider.im/microsoft-azure-communication-services-handling-high-volume-email-traffic/).

### ðŸ§ª **Example Use Case**
You can send thousands of emails using a loop or batch processing logic in your backend (e.g., Java or .NET), fetching recipient data from a database or CMS, rendering templates, and dispatching via ACS.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Important Notes**
- **Domain Verification** is required before sending.
- **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** setup is recommended for deliverability.
- **Pricing** is pay-as-you-go: e.g., \$0.00025 per email + data transfer [1](https://www.schneider.im/microsoft-azure-communication-services-handling-high-volume-email-traffic/).
