Great choice! A CMS-based approach is ideal for empowering business users to manage email templates without needing developer intervention. Here's how you can architect this with **Azure Communication Services (ACS)**:

### ðŸ§± **Recommended Architecture**

#### **1. CMS for Template Management**
Use a headless CMS like:
- **Strapi** (self-hosted, Node.js-based)
- **Contentful** (SaaS, easy UI)
- **Sanity**, **Directus**, or **DatoCMS**

Business users can:
- Create/edit templates with placeholders (e.g., `{{userName}}`, `{{orderId}}`)
- Preview and publish versions
- Tag templates by type (e.g., welcome, invoice, alert)

#### **2. Email Dispatch Service**
Build a microservice that:
- Fetches the template from CMS via API
- Replaces placeholders with dynamic data
- Sends the email using ACS Email SDK

#### **3. Template Rendering**
Use a templating engine like:
- `Handlebars` (Node.js)
- `Liquid` (used by Shopify, works well with CMS)
- `Jinja2` (Python)

#### **4. Security & Governance**
- Use **role-based access** in CMS for business users
- Validate template content before sending (e.g., HTML sanitization)
- Log template usage and errors for auditing

### ðŸ”„ **Workflow Example**

1. **Business User** creates a template in CMS:
   - Subject: `Welcome, {{userName}}!`
   - Body: `Hi {{userName}}, thanks for joining {{platformName}}.`

2. **App** triggers email dispatch:
   - Sends data: `{ userName: "Sridhar", platformName: "MyApp" }`

3. **Email Service**:
   - Fetches template from CMS
   - Renders final content
   - Sends via ACS
