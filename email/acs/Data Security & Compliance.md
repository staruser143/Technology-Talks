Azure Communication Services (ACS) provides a strong set of **data security and compliance features** to help organizations meet regulatory and privacy requirements. Here's a breakdown of the key capabilities:

---

### üîê **Security Features**

#### **1. Data Encryption**
- **At Rest**: All customer content (e.g., email, chat, SMS) is encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-communication-services-security-baseline).
- **In Transit**: Data is encrypted using TLS during transmission.

#### **2. Identity and Access Management**
- Integrates with **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** for secure identity management.
- Supports **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict access to resources.

#### **3. No Host/OS Access**
- Customers do **not** have access to the underlying host or operating system, reducing attack surface [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-communication-services-security-baseline).

### üåç **Data Residency and Privacy**

#### **1. Regional Data Storage**
- When provisioning ACS, you choose a **geography** (e.g., India, Europe, US).
- All data (email, chat, call logs) is stored in that geography, though it may transit through other regions for performance [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/privacy).

#### **2. Data Retention Policies**
- You can configure retention for chat threads, call recordings, and logs.
- Email logs are stored in **Azure Monitor**, and you control the workspace and retention [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/privacy).

#### **3. Data Deletion APIs**
- APIs available to delete:
  - Identities (`DeleteIdentity`)
  - Chat messages and threads
  - Phone numbers
  - Call recordings (after 24 hours)
