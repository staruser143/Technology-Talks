Great question! **Miro** is a powerful visual collaboration tool, and integrating your **Mermaid.js diagrams** into Miro can be done effectively — though **Miro does not natively render Mermaid code**. However, there are several **best practices** to bring your diagrams into Miro clearly and maintain their value for collaboration.

Here’s how to **appropriately add and use your Mermaid diagrams in Miro**:

---

## ✅ **Recommended Approach: Export as SVG/PNG and Embed**

### 🔹 Step-by-Step: Add Diagram to Miro

### 1. **Render the Mermaid Diagram**
Use the [**Mermaid Live Editor**](https://mermaid.live) to:
- Paste your Mermaid code
- Preview the diagram
- Ensure it looks correct

### 2. **Export as SVG (Best Option)**
Click:
> **"Download Image" → "SVG"**

✅ Why SVG?
- **Scalable** (no pixelation when zooming)
- **Editable text** (if needed in Miro)
- **Smaller file size** than PNG for simple diagrams
- Looks sharp on Miro’s infinite canvas

> 📌 Tip: SVG preserves quality when teammates zoom in during a workshop or review.

### 3. **Drag & Drop into Miro**
- Open your Miro board
- Drag the downloaded `.svg` file into the canvas
- Resize as needed

✅ Done! Your diagram is now embedded and visually clear.

## 🖼️ Alternative: Use PNG (If SVG Rendering is Poor)

If SVG appears blurry or misaligned in Miro (rare, but possible):

1. Export as **PNG** from Mermaid Live Editor
2. Drag into Miro
3. Adjust size

> PNG is raster-based, so avoid extreme zooming.

---

## 🧩 Advanced: Use Miro’s "Embed" Feature (Live Link)

You can **embed a live link** to the Mermaid Live Editor or your internal documentation:

### 1. **Save Diagram in Mermaid Live**
Click **"Save"** → Copy the **shareable link**

### 2. **In Miro, Use the "Embed" Widget**
- Click the **+** or search for "Embed"
- Paste the Mermaid Live URL
- Miro will show a **clickable preview**

✅ Benefit:
- Teammates can **click to open and interact** with the live diagram
- Great for **editable architecture docs**

⚠️ Limitation:
- Not visible offline
- Requires internet to view

## 🎨 Pro Tips for Using Diagrams in Miro

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|-----|--------------|
| **Add a border + label** | E.g., "Path 1: Kafka → KEDA → Job" |
| **Use color coding** | Match your Mermaid styles for consistency |
| **Group with sticky notes** | Explain assumptions, risks, or ownership |
| **Link to Confluence/Docs** | Add a connector to full technical documentation |
| **Layer multiple diagrams** | Place all 4 paths on one board, spaced clearly |
| **Use frames** | Put each diagram in a Miro Frame for clean layout |

---

## 📁 Optional: Create a Miro Template

You can build a **reusable Miro board template** for "Event-Driven Architecture in AKS" with:

- 4 frames (one per path)
- Each with:
  - Embedded SVG diagram
  - Description
  - Owner, status, decision date
- Add a **comparison matrix** sticky note

🔁 Reuse for future designs or reviews.

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Recreate in Miro (Manual, but Collaborative)

If you want full interactivity:
- Recreate the diagram **manually in Miro** using shapes, connectors, and text
- Use **color styles** to match your Mermaid theme
- Add **comments, tags, or voting** for team input

✅ Best for **collaborative design sessions**
❌ Time-consuming for complex diagrams

## 📎 Summary: Best Way to Add Mermaid Diagram to Miro

| Method | When to Use | Recommendation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **SVG/PNG Export** | Most common, high fidelity | ✅✅ **Recommended** |
| **Embed Live Link** | Want interactivity | ✅ Great for shared docs |
| **Manual Recreation** | Team workshop or editability | ✅ For collaboration |
| **PDF Import** | Formal documentation | ⚠️ Less flexible |

---

### ✅ Final Recommendation

> **Export your Mermaid diagrams as SVG from [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live), then drag them into Miro.**  
> Add titles, descriptions, and links to keep them actionable.

This gives you:
- **High-quality visuals**
- **Fast setup**
- **Scalability**
- **Team collaboration**
