The core components for all these scenarios are:
 * The Batch Process Logic: Your application code, built and packaged as a container image.
 * Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): The environment where the job will be executed.
 * Kubernetes Job Resource: The final object created in AKS that orchestrates the execution of your container.
   
Here is a descriptive blueprint for a visual diagram of the three different event-driven architectures.

Scenario 1: Triggering a Job from a Kafka Topic
This architecture uses Argo Events as the intermediary to connect a Kafka topic to a Kubernetes Job.

Visual Flow:
 * Source: A service publishes an event to a Kafka Topic.
 * Intermediary: The Argo Events EventSource (a component running in the AKS cluster) is configured to connect to and listen to this Kafka Topic.
   * The EventSource consumes messages from the topic.
 * Action: The Argo Events Sensor (another component in the cluster) monitors the EventSource.
   * The Sensor is configured with a Data Filter to check the incoming Kafka message payload for a specific condition (e.g., event.type == "special").
   * If the condition is met, the Sensor executes a Trigger.
 * Result: The Trigger makes a call to the Kubernetes API to create a new Job resource.
 * Execution: The newly created Job launches a pod that pulls your container image and executes the batch process.

   
Scenario 2: Triggering a Job from an Azure Service Bus Queue
This architecture uses KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) to connect the queue to the batch job.

Visual Flow:
 * Source: A service publishes a message to an Azure Service Bus Queue.
 * Intermediary: The KEDA Service Bus Scaler (a component running in the AKS cluster) is configured to connect to and monitor the message count in this queue.
   * It securely authenticates using an Azure AD Workload Identity.
 * Action: The KEDA ScaledJob Controller monitors the scaler.
   * When the scaler detects there is at least one message in the queue, the controller initiates the process.
 * Result: The ScaledJob controller creates one or more new Job resources to process the messages.
 * Execution: Each Job launches a pod that pulls your container image, connects to the queue, and processes one or more messages.
   * Scaling: As more messages arrive, KEDA can create more concurrent Jobs (up to a configurable maximum) to process the workload in parallel.
   * Scale-to-Zero: When the queue is empty, KEDA scales the number of running Jobs back down to zero.
  
     
Scenario 3: Triggering a Job from an Azure Logic App
This architecture uses Azure Logic Apps as the intermediary to connect a source event to the Kubernetes API.

Visual Flow:
 * Source: A service performs an action that triggers a Logic App workflow (e.g., an event in Azure Blob Storage, a message in a Service Bus Queue, an HTTP request).
 * Intermediary: The Logic App workflow is triggered.
   * The workflow contains an HTTP Action configured to call the Kubernetes API server.
   * It uses a Service Account Token stored in Azure Key Vault for secure authentication.
 * Action: The HTTP Action sends a POST request to the Kubernetes API endpoint for creating a Job.
   * The request body contains the JSON manifest for the Job resource.
   * The manifest can include dynamic values from the Logic App's trigger.
 * Result: The Kubernetes API server receives the request and creates a new Job resource.
 * Execution: The newly created Job launches a pod that pulls your container image and executes the batch process.
