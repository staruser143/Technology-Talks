Excellent questions — you're thinking about two key areas:

1. Lifecycle of messages in Azure Service Bus (ASB) queues


2. Idempotency and duplicate handling when producing from Kafka to ASB (since Kafka topics are immutable)



Let’s break both down in detail.


---

✅ 1. Azure Service Bus Queue: Message Lifecycle

Yes — once a message is successfully processed, it is removed from the queue. Here’s what happens:

🔄 Message Processing Lifecycle in ASB Queue

1. A consumer (e.g., Logic App or NestJS service) receives the message.


2. It processes the logic (e.g., send email, update DB).


3. If processing succeeds:

The consumer completes the message (completeMessage() in SDK)

Azure removes it from the queue



4. If processing fails:

Consumer can abandon, defer, or dead-letter the message

Retry logic applies based on max delivery count, lock duration, etc.




✅ So: Yes, ASB messages are removed upon success, just like in a traditional queue system.

🚧 2. Kafka Topic: Producing to ASB Queue Again and Again?

Since Kafka is append-only and does not support in-place updates, you’re right: It will not know if an event has already been processed unless:

You track outbox state elsewhere

Or implement deduplication logic downstream


🔁 Typical Kafka-to-Queue Flow:

Kafka Topic (app-events-topic)
   └──> Kafka Consumer (NestJS)
         ├─ Checks: "Is broker, missing signature, not already reminded?"
         ├─ If yes → produce to ASB Queue
         └─ Else → ignore

🔐 How to Avoid Duplicate Messages from Kafka to ASB?

✅ Approach 1: Maintain Outbox Tracking Table (Recommended)

Maintain a DB collection/table with:

eventId

appId

signatureReminderSent = true/false

retryCount


Your Kafka consumer (in NestJS) does:

1. Listens to Kafka topic (app-events-topic)


2. Checks your outbox table:

Has reminder already been sent?

Has max retries been exceeded?



3. If no → Produce to ASB queue


4. Update outbox table (signatureReminderSent = true)



This way, even if Kafka replays the message (due to restarts, reprocessing, etc.), you don’t double-send.


---

✅ Approach 2: Use Message Deduplication in ASB (if needed)

Azure Service Bus queues support message deduplication if you enable it and set a messageId:

Deduplication window is 10 minutes to 7 days

If duplicate messageId arrives within that time → it’s dropped silently


🔹 This protects you only for recent duplicates, so it’s good for near-term reprocessing but not full replay.


---

🔁 And what about the Kafka topic? Can it retain messages?

Yes — Kafka messages are never deleted immediately. They stay based on:

Time-based retention (e.g., 7 days)

Log size-based retention

Manual deletion policies


So if you want to reprocess historical events or rerun workflows, Kafka allows that.

✅ Summary Table

Concern	Kafka Topic	ASB Queue

Can we update a message?	❌ No — append-only	✅ No update, but can delete after processing
Are messages removed after success?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Can duplicates happen?	✅ Yes — replay possible	❌ Only if logic allows it
How to avoid reprocessing?	Track state externally (DB or cache)	Use message ID deduplication or logic

🧠 Best Practice Architecture

Kafka Topic: app-events
    ↓
Kafka Consumer (NestJS)
    - Check DB/outbox: was reminder already sent for appId?
    - If not sent & still valid:
        - Produce to ASB Queue (set messageId = appId + eventType)
        - Mark reminderSent = true in DB

    ↓
Azure Service Bus Queue
    ↓
Azure Logic App
    - Sends email
    - Updates MongoDB retry count

Let me know if you want a sample DB schema for outbox tracking or a NestJS consumer pattern to safely produce to ASB with deduplication.
