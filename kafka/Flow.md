It's an excellent idea to visualize this architecture! A diagram makes the interactions much clearer. Here's a Mermaid diagram representing how your NestJS components, MongoDB ChangeStream, and Azure Service Bus work together, including the active-standby publisher and scaling consumers.

Explanation of the Diagram:
 * Kubernetes Cluster & Application Pods:
   * This represents your deployment environment. You deploy N identical replicas of your NestJS application. Each replica runs as a Kubernetes Pod.
   * Each Pod encapsulates the Leader Election Service, ChangeStream Producer Service, and Read Model Consumer Service. This is what "part of the same deployment unit" means â€“ they are co-located within the same process.
 * External Dependencies:
   * MongoDB Replica Set/Sharded Cluster: Your source collection where events are stored. ChangeStream taps into its oplog.
   * Azure Service Bus Topic (AZ_SB): The message broker. Crucially configured with Partitioning and a Session-enabled Subscription.
   * MongoDB Offsets/Leases DB (Mongo_Offset_DB): A dedicated MongoDB collection used for:
     * Leader Election Leases: Stores which instance is the current leader and its heartbeat/expiry time.
     * ChangeStream Resume Tokens: Stores the _id of the last successfully processed event by the active ChangeStream Producer. This allows resuming after restarts/failovers.
   * MongoDB Read Model DB (ReadModel_DB): Your sink collection where the denormalized read models are built.
 * Leader Election Flow (Red Arrows):
   * All Leader Election Service (LE) instances (LE1, LE2, LEN) in every Pod periodically attempt to acquire or renew a lease in the Mongo_Offset_DB.
   * The Mongo_Offset_DB acts as the single source of truth for leadership. Only one instance succeeds in holding the valid, unexpired lease (leaderId matches its instanceId).
   * The Mongo_Offset_DB also provides the lease status back to all LE instances.
 * Publisher Flow - Active-Standby (Blue Arrows):
   * All ChangeStream Producer Service (CSP) instances (CSP1, CSP2, CSPN) continuously check with their co-located Leader Election Service (isLeader property).
   * Only the instance whose CSP is associated with the ACTIVE Leader (e.g., CSP1 in the diagram as CSP_Active) will:
     * Watch the MongoDB ChangeStream. This means it opens a connection and receives all changes from the MongoDB_RS.
     * Publish Events to Azure Service Bus. It transforms the ChangeStream event into a Service Bus message, setting the PartitionKey and SessionId to the aggregateId (e.g., event.aggregateId). This ensures all related events are grouped.
     * Persist its Resume Token to the Mongo_Offset_DB after successfully publishing an event. This is the single, shared point of truth for stream progress.
   * The STANDBY CSPs (CSP_Standby, CSP_StandbyN) remain idle; they do not watch the ChangeStream or publish events.
   * If the active leader fails, the Leader Election process quickly designates a new leader, and that new leader's CSP will take over, loading the last saved resume token to seamlessly continue.
 * Consumer Flow - Active-Active (Green Arrows):
   * All Read Model Consumer Service (RMC) instances (RMC1, RMC2, RMCN) in every Pod are active simultaneously.
   * They all subscribe to the same Azure Service Bus Topic and Subscription.
   * Azure Service Bus's partitioning and session features guarantee that:
     * Messages for a specific aggregateId (due to PartitionKey and SessionId) are routed to a single partition within the topic.
     * Only one RMC instance acquires the session for that aggregateId at any given time.
     * Messages within that session are delivered to that RMC in order.
   * Each RMC then processes the events it receives and performs idempotent upserts to update the ReadModel_DB. Idempotency handles potential retries or eventual consistency concerns.
This diagram clearly illustrates the active-standby pattern for the producer (ensuring no duplicate reading from ChangeStream and consistent resume token management) and the active-active, partitioned pattern for the consumers (ensuring scalable, ordered, and non-duplicate processing for Read Model updates).
