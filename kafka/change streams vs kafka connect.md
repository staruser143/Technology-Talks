Great observation! You're rightâ€”there are **two main approaches** to sync data from a MongoDB collection to Kafka:

1. **Kafka Connect with MongoDB Source Connector**
2. **Custom NestJS Service using MongoDB Change Streams**

Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of both approaches:

---

## ðŸ”„ Kafka Connect vs. NestJS Change Stream Service

| Feature | **Kafka Connect (MongoDB Source Connector)** | **NestJS Change Stream Service** |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Low to Medium (configuration-based) | Medium to High (custom code) |
| **Scalability** | High (built-in distributed mode) | Depends on your service architecture |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Built-in (offsets stored in Kafka) | Must be implemented manually |
| **Performance** | Optimized for streaming large volumes | Depends on implementation |
| **Monitoring & Management** | REST API, Kafka Connect UI, metrics | Requires custom logging and monitoring |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to connector capabilities | Full control over logic and transformations |
| **Deployment** | Separate Kafka Connect cluster | Part of your NestJS microservices |
| **Change Stream Support** | Yes (uses MongoDB change streams internally) | Yes (directly uses MongoDB change streams) |
| **Use Case Fit** | Best for standard ETL pipelines | Best for custom logic or tight integration with app code |
| **Error Handling** | Built-in retry and dead letter queue support | Must be coded manually |
| **Maintenance** | Lower (config-driven) | Higher (code maintenance) |

## âœ… When to Use Kafka Connect

- You want a **low-code, config-driven** solution.
- You need to **stream data from multiple sources** into Kafka.
- You want **built-in fault tolerance and scalability**.
- You prefer **standardized connectors** over custom code.

---

## âœ… When to Use NestJS Change Stream Service

- You need **custom business logic** before publishing to Kafka.
- You want to **integrate tightly** with your existing NestJS services.
- You need **fine-grained control** over error handling, transformation, or filtering.
- Youâ€™re working in a **microservices architecture** and want to avoid managing Kafka Connect separately.
