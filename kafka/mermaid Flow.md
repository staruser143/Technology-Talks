Absolutely! Here's a Mermaid diagram that visually represents the full architecture and event flow for your use case involving:

Kafka for capturing application events

NestJS as the Kafka consumer

Azure Service Bus Queue for filtered event delivery

Azure Logic Apps for email notification and database update

MongoDB or another DB for outbox tracking and retry counts

🔄 Flow Summary:

1. Kafka Topic receives all application events.


2. NestJS Kafka Consumer processes the stream:

For each event, checks Outbox DB to determine if a signature reminder was already sent.

If not sent and valid:

Produces a message to the Azure Service Bus Queue (optionally using deduplication ID).

Updates Outbox DB to mark reminder sent.




3. Azure Logic App:

Triggers on queue message.

Sends email to the user.

Updates retry counts or timestamps in MongoDB or the Outbox DB.





---

🛡️ Deduplication Options

Enable deduplication in ASB Queue (messageId = appId + eventType)

Track sent status in Outbox DB

Kafka topic acts as a reliable source for replays if needed

Let me know if you want this same architecture represented in multi-tab Mermaid, or with environment separation like Kafka Cluster | AKS | Azure Platform, or if you’d like to extend it with monitoring/tracing.
