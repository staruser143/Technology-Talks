Great follow-up — and you're absolutely right to think deeply about reuse of Kafka events instead of pulling from the database. Let’s address both of your smart observations in detail:


---

🔁 Q1: Why not use Kafka topics instead of reading from the DB in Logic Apps?

✅ Yes, you can use Kafka as your source of truth if:

You are strictly event-driven

You already append all application events (including broker submissions, status updates, etc.) to a Kafka topic

You don’t need to re-query mutable state (like retryCount, status flags) from a database


🚧 But here's the nuance:

Kafka is append-only and stateless, meaning it doesn't naturally track:

Retry attempts (retryCount)

When the next attempt should happen (nextAttemptAt)

Whether the signature was received after 5 retries


So even if you use Kafka to drive the process, you still need a mutable store (like MongoDB or a Redis cache or Azure Table Storage) to track retry attempts per application.


---

✅ Viable hybrid:

You can design a system where:

Kafka holds immutable application events (source of truth)

A Kafka stream processing service (like Kafka Streams, Flink, or NestJS Kafka consumers):

Listens to new events

Maintains broker-app retry state in a durable store (e.g., MongoDB or Redis)

Pushes "Reminder needed" events into a Service Bus Queue with scheduled delay or immediate delivery


Logic Apps picks up these reminder events from Service Bus, sends email, and updates status if needed.



---

📬 Q2: If we use Azure Service Bus (ASB) Queue, isn’t that a filtered version of the Kafka topic?

✅ Yes — and that's actually good architecture.

Think of Azure Service Bus Queue as a downstream, targeted delivery mechanism for very specific workflows.

📦 Architecture Flow:

Kafka Topic (application-events-topic)
       |
       |---> Domain Read Model Builder (builds Mongo Read model)
       |
       |---> Kafka Consumer for Reminder Logic
                   |
                   |---> Applies business logic (is broker, retry < 5, no signature yet)
                   |---> Enqueues message to Azure Service Bus Queue (e.g. `broker-signature-reminder-queue`)
                                     |
                                     v
                        Logic App picks up -> Sends Email -> Updates state

✅ Why this works well:

Keeps Kafka topic clean and generalized

Lets Kafka do what it does best: append-only event log

Pushes retry-time-sensitive, logic-specific tasks to ASB queues

Azure Logic Apps consume from ASB queues easily with built-in connectors

Avoids tight coupling of Logic Apps with Kafka directly

🧠 Recommendation for Your Use Case

Here’s a scalable, cloud-native architecture using both Kafka and ASB:

┌─────────────────────────────┐
                                │ Kafka Topic: app-events     │
                                │ (Enrollment Event Stream)   │
                                └─────────────┬───────────────┘
                                              │
   ┌───────────────────────────┐              │              ┌────────────────────────────┐
   │ Kafka Consumer (NestJS)   │              │              │ MongoDB (Read Model)       │
   │  - Listens for app events │◄─────────────┘              │  - Tracks retryCount       │
   │  - If broker + no sig     │                             │  - Signature status        │
   │    enqueue to ASB Queue   │                             └────────────────────────────┘
   └────────────┬──────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Azure Service Bus Queue: broker-signature-reminder│
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Azure Logic App                                   │
│ - Triggered on ASB queue message                  │
│ - Sends email                                     │
│ - Calls API or updates MongoDB with retry info    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

📝 TL;DR

Option	Role

Kafka topic	Immutable event log for all applications
MongoDB or other DB	Mutable state (retryCount, nextAttemptAt, signature status)
NestJS Kafka Consumer	Processes app events, decides when to remind
Azure Service Bus Queue	Buffer for broker-specific signature reminders
Azure Logic App	Periodic or event-triggered reminder workflow
