I have a mongo collection app_events which is used as an event store.  I have eventId and appId as the fields along with other required fields. An app identified by appId can have many events, identified by eventId.  Each event is appended as a separate document to the app_events collection. I want to process these events  to build READ model domain mongo collection using Kafka. How do I write these events to a Kafka topic, app_events_topic and then use Kafka Consumers to process them and build the READ model domain mongo collection.

To build a **READ model domain MongoDB collection** from your `app_events` event store using **Kafka**, you'll need to follow a pipeline that includes:

1. **Producing events to Kafka** from MongoDB.
2. **Consuming events from Kafka** to process and build the READ model.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Write Events to Kafka Topic (`app_events_topic`)**

You can use **MongoDB Change Streams** to capture inserts into the `app_events` collection and publish them to Kafka.

#### 🔧 Technologies:
- MongoDB Change Streams
- Kafka Producer (e.g., using Python, Java, or Kafka Connect)

#### 🧩 Option 1: Using Kafka Connect (Recommended for Production)
Use the **MongoDB Kafka Connector** to stream changes directly from MongoDB to Kafka.

**Connector Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "mongo-app-events-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "connection.uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "database": "your_db",
    "collection": "app_events",
    "topic.prefix": "app_events_topic",
    "change.stream.full.document": "updateLookup"
  }
}
```

This will stream every insert/update/delete from `app_events` to Kafka topic `app_events_topic`.

#### 🧩 Option 2: Custom Producer (e.g., Python)
If you prefer custom logic:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")
db = client["your_db"]
collection = db["app_events"]

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

with collection.watch() as stream:
    for change in stream:
        if change["operationType"] == "insert":
            event = change["fullDocument"]
            producer.send("app_events_topic", event)
```

---

### **Step 2: Kafka Consumer to Build READ Model**

Create a Kafka Consumer that listens to `app_events_topic`, processes each event, and updates the READ model MongoDB collection.

#### 🧩 Example in Python:
```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
from pymongo import MongoClient
import json

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'app_events_topic',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8'))
)

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")
read_db = client["read_model_db"]
read_collection = read_db["read_model"]

for message in consumer:
    event = message.value
    app_id = event["appId"]
    event_id = event["eventId"]
    
    # Custom logic to build/update the READ model
    read_collection.update_one(
        {"appId": app_id},
        {"$push": {"events": event}},
        upsert=True
    )
```

---

### ✅ Tips for Production:
- Use **schema registry** with Avro/Protobuf for structured events.
- Ensure **idempotency** in consumers to avoid duplicate processing.
- Use **Kafka Streams** or **ksqlDB** for more advanced transformations.
- Monitor with tools like **Kafka Manager**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**.

# Query
I see Kafka supports partitioning . Should I set a partition key when writing to Kafka from Mongo events collection and ensure that each partition gets processed only by a unique Kafka Consumer, assuming I run multiple Kafka Consumers as part of a consumer group.

Yes, you're absolutely right — **Kafka partitioning** plays a crucial role in scaling and parallelizing event processing. Here's how you can leverage it effectively in your scenario:

---

### ✅ **Why Use Partitioning with a Key?**

Kafka partitions allow you to:
- **Distribute load** across multiple consumers.
- **Maintain order** of events for a given key (e.g., `appId`).
- **Scale horizontally** by adding more consumers.

---

### 🔑 **Choosing a Partition Key**

In your case, using `appId` as the **partition key** is a good strategy because:
- It ensures **all events for a given app** go to the same partition.
- This guarantees **event order** for each app is preserved.
- It allows **parallel processing** across different apps.

#### Example Kafka Producer (Python):
```python
producer.send(
    topic="app_events_topic",
    key=event["appId"].encode("utf-8"),  # Partition key
    value=json.dumps(event).encode("utf-8")
)
```

---

### 👥 **Kafka Consumer Group Behavior**

When you run **multiple consumers in a consumer group**:
- Kafka assigns **partitions to consumers** such that **each partition is processed by only one consumer**.
- This ensures **no duplication** and **parallelism** across partitions.

#### Example:
- You have 3 partitions and 3 consumers in a group.
- Kafka assigns one partition to each consumer.
- Each consumer processes events for a subset of `appId`s.

---

### 🧠 Best Practices

1. **Partition Count**:
   - Choose based on expected throughput and number of consumers.
   - You can increase partitions later, but rebalancing may be needed.

2. **Consumer Group**:
   - All consumers processing the same topic should be in the **same group** to benefit from partition-based parallelism.

3. **Idempotent Processing**:
   - Ensure your READ model updates are idempotent to handle retries safely.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Use Kafka metrics to monitor lag, throughput, and partition assignment.

    topic="app_events_topic",
    key=event["appId"].encode("utf-8"),  # Partition key
    value=json.dumps(event).encode("utf-8")
)
```

# Query
Could i do the same with Kafka Connect similar to using a Kafka producer in python.

Yes, you can absolutely achieve partitioned event streaming using **Kafka Connect**, similar to how you would with a custom Kafka producer in Python — but with some differences in control and configuration.

---

### 🔄 Kafka Connect with Partitioning

Kafka Connect handles partitioning **automatically** based on the **key** you provide in the source record. If you want to control which partition an event goes to (e.g., based on `appId`), you need to ensure that:

1. The **Kafka record key** is set to `appId`.
2. The **Kafka topic** has multiple partitions.
3. The **Kafka Connect source connector** is configured to include the key.

---

### ✅ How to Set the Key in Kafka Connect (MongoDB Source Connector)

In the **MongoDB Kafka Source Connector**, you can use the `key.converter` and `key.document` settings to define the key.

#### Example Configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "mongo-app-events-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "connection.uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "database": "your_db",
    "collection": "app_events",
    "topic.prefix": "app_events_topic",
    "change.stream.full.document": "updateLookup",
    
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
    "key.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.appId\" }"
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Uses `appId` from the MongoDB document as the Kafka record key.
- Ensures Kafka uses this key to determine the partition.

---

### 👥 Consumer Group Behavior

Once events are partitioned by `appId`, your **Kafka consumers in a group** will:
- Each consume from a **unique subset of partitions**.
- Maintain **event order per appId**.
- Enable **parallel processing** across apps.

---

### 🧠 Notes

- You can **scale consumers** by increasing the number of partitions and consumers.
- Kafka Connect itself doesn’t control partitioning logic — it relies on Kafka’s default partitioner which uses the key’s hash.
- You can also use a **custom partitioner** if needed, but that’s more common in custom producers.

---

# Query
Why do we need to add key.converter config to be set as StringConverter and also what If the field appId is a child field within a parent field in mongo document structure, could i still use key.document to specify that field as key.

Great questions! Let's break them down:

---

### 🔧 Why Set `key.converter` to `StringConverter`?

Kafka Connect uses **converters** to serialize and deserialize keys and values when transferring data between Kafka and external systems.

- **`key.converter`** defines how the **key** of the Kafka message is serialized.
- **`value.converter`** does the same for the **value** (the actual event data).

#### ✅ Why `StringConverter`?
If you're using a simple string key like `appId`, then `StringConverter` is appropriate because:
- It serializes the key as a plain string.
- It’s lightweight and easy to use.
- It works well with Kafka’s default partitioning logic (which hashes the key).

If you were using structured keys (e.g., JSON or Avro), you’d use `JsonConverter` or `AvroConverter` instead.

---

### 🧩 What If `appId` Is Nested?

Yes, you can still use `key.document` to extract a nested field from the MongoDB document.

#### Example:
Suppose your MongoDB document looks like this:
```json
{
  "eventId": "e123",
  "app": {
    "appId": "app456"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T10:00:00Z"
}
```

You can set `key.document` like this:
```json
"key.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.app.appId\" }"
```

This uses **JSONPath syntax** (`$.app.appId`) to extract the nested `appId` field.

---

### 🧠 Summary

| Scenario | Configuration |
|----------|----------------|
| Flat `appId` field | `"key.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.appId\" }"` |
| Nested `appId` field | `"key.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.app.appId\" }"` |
| Key as string | `"key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter"` |
| Key as JSON | `"key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"` |

---

# Query
Can a key be a JSON structure instead of a String. If so how would we set it as a key when writing to kafka topic using kafka connect. can you provide an example for that.

Yes, Kafka **does support JSON structures as keys**, and you can configure **Kafka Connect** to use a JSON key when writing to a Kafka topic. This is useful when you want to use a composite key (e.g., `{ "appId": "app123", "eventType": "created" }`) for partitioning or downstream processing.

---

### ✅ How to Set a JSON Key in Kafka Connect

To use a JSON structure as the key, you need to:

1. Set the **`key.converter`** to `JsonConverter`.
2. Define the **`key.document`** to extract the fields from the MongoDB document.
3. Optionally, configure the schema settings depending on whether you use a schema registry.

---

### 🧩 Example Configuration (MongoDB Source Connector)

```json
{
  "name": "mongo-app-events-json-key",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "connection.uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "database": "your_db",
    "collection": "app_events",
    "topic.prefix": "app_events_topic",
    "change.stream.full.document": "updateLookup",

    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",

    "key.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.app.appId\", \"eventType\": \"$.type\" }",

    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false"
  }
}
```

### 🔍 Breakdown:
- **`key.converter`**: Uses JSON for the key.
- **`key.document`**: Extracts `appId` from a nested field and `eventType` from the root.
- **`schemas.enable`**: Set to `false` if you don’t use a schema registry.

---

### 🧠 Notes:
- Kafka will hash the **entire JSON key** to determine the partition.
- Consumers must be able to deserialize the JSON key correctly (i.e., use the same `JsonDeserializer`).
- You can use more complex keys if needed, including nested structures.

---


# Query
Show me a consumer example for JSON keys.
Here’s a **Kafka consumer example in Python** that reads messages with **JSON keys and JSON values**, assuming you're using the `confluent-kafka` or `kafka-python` library.

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Kafka topic: `app_events_topic`
- Messages have:
  - **Key**: JSON (e.g., `{ "appId": "app123", "eventType": "created" }`)
  - **Value**: JSON (e.g., full event document)
- Kafka Connect is configured with `JsonConverter` for both key and value.

---

### 🧩 Python Consumer Example (Using `kafka-python`)

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json

# Create a Kafka consumer
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'app_events_topic',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    key_deserializer=lambda k: json.loads(k.decode('utf-8')) if k else None,
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8')),
    group_id='read-model-consumer-group',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    enable_auto_commit=True
)

# Consume messages
for message in consumer:
    key = message.key  # JSON key
    value = message.value  # JSON value

    print(f"Received event for appId={key['appId']} with type={key['eventType']}")
    print(f"Event data: {value}")

    # TODO: Update your READ model MongoDB collection here
```

---

### 🧠 Notes

- The `key_deserializer` and `value_deserializer` convert the byte stream into Python dictionaries.
- You can use `pymongo` to update your READ model MongoDB collection based on the event.
- Make sure your Kafka topic has enough partitions to benefit from parallelism if you're running multiple consumers.

---

# Query
Add MongoDB update logic to the example.

Here’s an updated **Kafka consumer example in Python** that includes **MongoDB update logic** to build your READ model domain collection:

---

### 🧩 Full Example: Kafka Consumer with MongoDB Update

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
from pymongo import MongoClient
import json

# Kafka Consumer setup
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'app_events_topic',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    key_deserializer=lambda k: json.loads(k.decode('utf-8')) if k else None,
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8')),
    group_id='read-model-consumer-group',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    enable_auto_commit=True
)

# MongoDB setup
mongo_client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")
read_db = mongo_client["read_model_db"]
read_collection = read_db["read_model"]

# Consume and process messages
for message in consumer:
    key = message.key  # JSON key: e.g., { "appId": "app123", "eventType": "created" }
    value = message.value  # JSON value: full event document

    app_id = key.get("appId")
    event_type = key.get("eventType")

    print(f"Processing event for appId={app_id}, type={event_type}")
    print(f"Event data: {value}")

    # Update READ model: append event to app's event list
    read_collection.update_one(
        {"appId": app_id},
        {
            "$push": {"events": value},
            "$setOnInsert": {"createdAt": value.get("timestamp")}
        },
        upsert=True
    )
```

---

### ✅ What This Does:
- **Consumes** events from Kafka with JSON keys and values.
- **Extracts** `appId` and `eventType` from the key.
- **Appends** the event to the corresponding document in the READ model collection.
- **Creates** the document if it doesn’t exist (`upsert=True`).

---

# Query
When creating a topic how do I decide on the number of partitions . Since there can be thousands or even millions of applications identified by their appId's. Do I have to create that much number of partitions.

That's a very insightful question — and you're absolutely right to think carefully about **partition count** when dealing with **millions of unique `appId`s**.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🧠 **Do You Need One Partition per `appId`?**
**No**, you do **not** need a partition for every `appId`. Kafka is designed to handle **many keys per partition** efficiently.

Instead, you should:
- Choose a **reasonable number of partitions** based on throughput and parallelism needs.
- Use a **partition key** (like `appId`) to ensure ordering per key.
- Let Kafka's **default partitioner** hash the key to assign it to a partition.

---

### 📊 **How to Decide Partition Count**

Here are some practical guidelines:

#### 1. **Throughput**
Estimate how many events per second you expect and how much each partition can handle.

> Example: If each partition can handle ~10,000 events/sec and you expect 100,000 events/sec, you might need ~10 partitions.

#### 2. **Consumer Parallelism**
Kafka allows **one consumer per partition** in a consumer group. So:
- If you want to run 20 consumers in parallel, you need **at least 20 partitions**.

#### 3. **Retention and Storage**
More partitions = more overhead in terms of disk usage, file handles, and metadata.

#### 4. **Rebalancing Cost**
Too many partitions can slow down rebalancing when consumers join/leave.

---

### ✅ **Recommended Strategy**

- Start with **a few dozen to a few hundred partitions** depending on expected load.
- Use **`appId` as the key** to ensure ordering per app.
- Monitor performance and **scale partitions** if needed (Kafka supports partition expansion).

---

### 🧩 Example Setup

```bash
# Create topic with 100 partitions
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --topic app_events_topic \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 100 \
  --replication-factor 1
```

---

### 🔍 Monitoring Tools
Use tools like:
- **Kafka Manager**
- **Confluent Control Center**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**

To monitor:
- Partition distribution
- Consumer lag
- Throughput

---

# Query
I can estimate 100,000 events/sec as expected events but how do I know how many events a partition can handle.

Great follow-up! Estimating how many events a **Kafka partition can handle per second** depends on several factors, and while there's no fixed number, we can walk through how to **approximate** it based on your setup.

---

### ⚙️ Factors That Influence Partition Throughput

1. **Message Size**  
   Smaller messages (e.g., <1 KB) can be processed much faster than larger ones (e.g., 10 KB+).

2. **Broker Hardware**  
   CPU, disk I/O, and network bandwidth all affect throughput.

3. **Replication Factor**  
   Higher replication means more overhead per message.

4. **Compression**  
   Using compression (e.g., `lz4`, `snappy`) can reduce bandwidth and improve throughput.

5. **Producer & Consumer Efficiency**  
   Batch size, linger time, and consumer processing logic impact throughput.

6. **Topic Configuration**  
   Log segment size, retention, and cleanup policies can affect performance.

---

### 📊 Ballpark Estimates

Here are **rough benchmarks** from real-world Kafka deployments:

| Message Size | Events/sec/partition (approx.) |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| ~1 KB        | 50,000 – 100,000               |
| ~10 KB       | 10,000 – 50,000                |
| ~100 KB      | 1,000 – 10,000                 |

So if your events are small (say ~1 KB), a **single partition** might handle **up to 100,000 events/sec** under optimal conditions.

---

### ✅ What You Can Do

Since you expect **100,000 events/sec**, here’s a safe approach:

- **Start with 20–50 partitions**.
- Monitor throughput, consumer lag, and broker load.
- Scale up partitions if needed (Kafka allows increasing partition count).

---

### 🔍 How to Measure Partition Capacity

To get a more accurate number for your setup, you can:
- Benchmark using tools like **Kafka Performance Test Tool** (`kafka-producer-perf-test.sh`)
- Simulate load with your actual event structure and measure throughput.

# Query

Would key.converter and key.document configs be the same for all type of connectors or would they differ based on the source type.

Excellent question! The use of `key.converter` and `key.document` in **Kafka Connect** does depend on the **type of connector** and the **source data format**, but the general principles remain consistent across connectors.

---

### ✅ General Purpose of These Configs

- **`key.converter`**: Defines how the Kafka message key is serialized/deserialized (e.g., String, JSON, Avro).
- **`key.document`**: Specifies how to extract the key from the source record (used mostly in source connectors like MongoDB, JDBC, etc.).

---

### 🔍 Connector-Specific Behavior

#### 1. **MongoDB Source Connector**
- Uses `key.document` to extract fields from MongoDB documents.
- Supports JSONPath syntax (e.g., `$.app.appId`).
- Common converters: `StringConverter`, `JsonConverter`.

#### 2. **JDBC Source Connector**
- Uses `table.whitelist` and `mode` to stream rows.
- You can set `key` using `key.column.name` (not `key.document`).
- Common converters: `JsonConverter`, `AvroConverter`.

#### 3. **FileStream Source Connector**
- Streams lines from a file.
- No concept of structured keys, so `key.converter` is often `StringConverter`.
- `key.document` is not applicable.

#### 4. **Debezium Connectors (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**
- Automatically sets keys based on primary key fields.
- You can configure `key.converter`, but not `key.document`.

---

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Connector Type       | Uses `key.document`? | Key Extraction Method         | Common `key.converter` |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| MongoDB Source       | ✅ Yes               | JSONPath from document        | String, JSON            |
| JDBC Source          | ❌ No                | `key.column.name`             | JSON, Avro              |
| FileStream Source    | ❌ No                | Not applicable                | String                  |
| Debezium (MySQL etc) | ❌ No                | Primary key from DB           | JSON, Avro              |

# Query

If I have to customize  value of the kafka topic , instead of the complete document as obtained from mongo collection , by specifying a fragment or part of the document structure or even a single field how could i do that with Kafka connect.

To customize the **value of the Kafka topic** in **Kafka Connect** — so that it contains only a **fragment** of the MongoDB document (e.g., a single field or a subset of fields) — you can use the **`value.document`** configuration in the **MongoDB Kafka Source Connector**.

---

### ✅ How to Use `value.document`

This config allows you to **extract specific fields** from the MongoDB document and use them as the Kafka message value.

#### 🧩 Example MongoDB Document:
```json
{
  "_id": "abc123",
  "app": {
    "appId": "app456",
    "name": "MyApp"
  },
  "type": "created",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T10:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "user": "john",
    "action": "login"
  }
}
```

#### 🧩 Desired Kafka Value:
```json
{
  "appId": "app456",
  "action": "login"
}
```

#### ✅ Kafka Connect Configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "mongo-app-events-custom-value",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "connection.uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "database": "your_db",
    "collection": "app_events",
    "topic.prefix": "app_events_topic",
    "change.stream.full.document": "updateLookup",

    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "key.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.app.appId\" }",

    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "value.document": "{ \"appId\": \"$.app.appId\", \"action\": \"$.payload.action\" }"
  }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Notes:
- `value.document` uses **JSONPath syntax** to extract fields.
- You can extract nested fields like `$.app.appId` or `$.payload.action`.
- The resulting Kafka message value will be a **custom JSON object** with only the specified fields.

---

# Query

Would writing same value of appId by as the key of the kafka topic record , seems like overwriting or duplicate value for same key ?

That's a great question — and it's a common point of confusion when working with Kafka.

---

### 🔑 **Does Using the Same `appId` as the Kafka Key Overwrite Messages?**

**No**, it does **not overwrite** messages.

Kafka is **not a key-value store** in the traditional sense. Even if multiple messages have the **same key** (e.g., `appId`), Kafka will:

- **Append** each message to the topic log.
- **Preserve** all messages in the order they were written.
- **Not overwrite** any previous message.

---

### 🧠 What Does the Key Actually Do?

The **key** in Kafka is used for:

1. **Partitioning**: Kafka uses the key to determine which partition a message goes to (via hashing).
2. **Ordering**: Messages with the same key are guaranteed to be **ordered** within a partition.
3. **Compaction (optional)**: If **log compaction** is enabled, Kafka will **retain only the latest message per key** — but only in compacted topics.

Unless you explicitly enable **log compaction**, Kafka will retain **all messages**, even with duplicate keys.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Feature | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Same key (`appId`) | Messages are appended, not overwritten |
| Ordering | Guaranteed per key within a partition |
| Partitioning | Key determines which partition the message goes to |
| Log compaction | Optional — retains only the latest message per key |

# Query
Does the same kafka connect configuration work even when using MongoDB Atlas as Source ?
Yes, the **Kafka Connect MongoDB Source Connector** works with **MongoDB Atlas**, but there are a few **important differences and additional steps** compared to using a local MongoDB instance.

---

### ✅ What Stays the Same
- You can still use `key.converter`, `value.converter`, `key.document`, and `value.document` to customize Kafka message structure.
- The connector class remains: `com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector`.

---

### 🔧 What You Need to Change for MongoDB Atlas

#### 1. **Connection URI**
Use your **MongoDB Atlas connection string**, which includes authentication and cluster info.

```json
"connection.uri": "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net"
```

Make sure:
- You whitelist the IP address of your Kafka Connect cluster in Atlas.
- You enable **change streams** by using a **replica set or sharded cluster** (Atlas supports this by default).

#### 2. **TLS/SSL**
Atlas requires **TLS encryption**, which is supported by default in the connector. No extra config is needed unless you're customizing SSL behavior.

#### 3. **Permissions**
Ensure the MongoDB user has the necessary roles:
- `read` on the source database.
- `readChangeStream` on the collection or database.

#### 4. **Change Stream Support**
Change streams are only available on:
- **Replica sets**
- **Sharded clusters**
- **MongoDB 4.0+**

Atlas meets these requirements, but your user must have the right privileges.

# Query
How about SMTs.  Do they serve the same purpose as providing the partition key and customizing the value of the kafka record being written by extracting specific fields from mongo document structure for value.

Excellent question! You're touching on a powerful feature of Kafka Connect: **Single Message Transforms (SMTs)**. Let's clarify how SMTs relate to `key.document`, `value.document`, and their role in customizing Kafka records.

---

### ✅ What Are SMTs?

**Single Message Transforms (SMTs)** are lightweight, pluggable transformations applied to individual messages as they pass through Kafka Connect. They can be used in both **source** and **sink** connectors.

---

### 🔍 SMTs vs. `key.document` / `value.document`

| Feature | Purpose | Applies To | Flexibility |
|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `key.document` / `value.document` | Extract specific fields from MongoDB documents | **MongoDB Source Connector only** | Limited to JSONPath expressions |
| **SMTs** | Transform Kafka records (key, value, headers, topic) | **Any connector** | Highly flexible (can rename, mask, filter, route, etc.) |

---

### 🧩 Use Cases for SMTs

- Extract or rename fields
- Drop unwanted fields
- Set key from a field
- Mask sensitive data
- Route messages to different topics
- Convert data formats

---

### ✅ Example: Extract Specific Fields Using SMT

Suppose your MongoDB document looks like this:

```json
{
  "_id": "abc123",
  "app": {
    "appId": "app456",
    "name": "MyApp"
  },
  "payload": {
    "user": "john",
    "action": "login"
  }
}
```

You want the Kafka **value** to contain only `appId` and `action`.

#### SMT Configuration:
```json
"transforms": "extractFields",
"transforms.extractFields.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Value",
"transforms.extractFields.field": "appId,action"
```

But since these are **nested fields**, you’d first need to **flatten** the structure:

```json
"transforms": "flatten,extractFields",
"transforms.flatten.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Flatten$Value",
"transforms.extractFields.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Value",
"transforms.extractFields.field": "app.appId,payload.action"
```

---

### ✅ Example: Set Kafka Key Using SMT

Instead of using `key.document`, you can use SMT to set the key from a field:

```json
"transforms": "setKey",
"transforms.setKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ValueToKey",
"transforms.setKey.fields": "app.appId"
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

- Use `key.document` / `value.document` for **simple field extraction** in MongoDB Source Connector.
- Use **SMTs** for **advanced transformations**, applicable across all connectors.
- SMTs are more flexible and composable.

---
# Query
Are you saying If I use SMT based config they would be supported across all connectors ?

Yes — you're absolutely right to ask this. Here's the key point:

### ✅ SMTs (Single Message Transforms) **are supported across all Kafka Connect connectors**, both **source** and **sink**, as long as the connector supports the Kafka Connect framework properly.

---

### 🔍 What This Means Practically

- You can use SMTs with:
  - **MongoDB Source Connector**
  - **JDBC Source Connector**
  - **Debezium Connectors**
  - **Elasticsearch Sink Connector**
  - **S3 Sink Connector**
  - And many others

- SMTs are **connector-agnostic** — they operate on the **Kafka Connect record**, not the source system directly.

---

### 🧩 Example Use Cases Across Connectors

#### ✅ MongoDB Source Connector
- Use SMTs to extract nested fields, flatten documents, or set the key from a field.

#### ✅ JDBC Source Connector
- Use SMTs to rename fields, mask sensitive columns, or route records to different topics.

#### ✅ S3 Sink Connector
- Use SMTs to format records before writing to S3 (e.g., remove metadata, change structure).

---

### ⚠️ Caveats

- While SMTs are broadly supported, **some connectors may have limitations** or **custom SMTs**.
- You must ensure the **record structure** (schema or schemaless) is compatible with the SMT you're applying.
- SMTs are applied **after the connector reads the data** but **before it writes to Kafka** (for source connectors) or **before it writes to the sink** (for sink connectors).

---

# Query
For my scenario, If I want to use appId as the partition key while writing to Kafka topic and also customize the value being written from the default complete document to a partial or single field how do i use SMTs in Kafka Connect for that.

To use **SMTs (Single Message Transforms)** in Kafka Connect to:

1. **Set `appId` as the Kafka record key** (used for partitioning), and  
2. **Customize the Kafka record value** to include only a partial document or a single field,

you can configure your **MongoDB Source Connector** with a combination of SMTs. Here's how:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step SMT Configuration

#### 🔹 1. **Set `appId` as the Kafka Key**

Use the `ValueToKey` SMT to extract `appId` from the document and set it as the Kafka key.

```json
"transforms": "setKey",
"transforms.setKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ValueToKey",
"transforms.setKey.fields": "app.appId"
```

> This ensures Kafka uses `appId` for partitioning.

---

#### 🔹 2. **Customize the Kafka Value**

Use the `ExtractField` SMT to keep only the desired field(s) in the Kafka value.

If you want just `payload.action`, you can do:

```json
"transforms": "setKey,flatten,extractValue",
"transforms.flatten.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Flatten$Value",
"transforms.extractValue.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Value",
"transforms.extractValue.field": "payload.action"
```

> The `Flatten$Value` SMT flattens nested fields so `payload.action` becomes accessible.

---

### 🧩 Full Kafka Connect Configuration Example

```json
{
  "name": "mongo-app-events-smt",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "connection.uri": "mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net",
    "database": "your_db",
    "collection": "app_events",
    "topic.prefix": "app_events_topic",
    "change.stream.full.document": "updateLookup",

    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false",

    "transforms": "setKey,flatten,extractValue",
    "transforms.setKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ValueToKey",
    "transforms.setKey.fields": "app.appId",
    "transforms.flatten.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Flatten$Value",
    "transforms.extractValue.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Value",
    "transforms.extractValue.field": "payload.action"
  }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Notes

- SMTs are applied **in order**, so `flatten` must come before `extractValue` if you're accessing nested fields.
- You can combine multiple SMTs to extract, rename, mask, or route data.
- This approach works with **MongoDB Atlas** and other connectors that support Kafka Connect.

# Query
I see the value for key as ""Struct{itemid=Item_3}" . Is this corret when using Datagen Source Connector for Confluent Cloud. I have used ValueToKey SMT  and set the value of "itemid" as key and also ExtractField$Value SMTs to extract value of  field "orderunits".  The original data written to kafka topic before using SMTs was "{
  "ordertime": 1503576632708,
  "orderid": 1528,
  "itemid": "Item_7",
  "orderunits": 7.1886285920682855,
  "address": {
    "city": "City_5",
    "state": "State_",
    "zipcode": 79628
  }
}

Thanks for sharing the context — you're using the **Datagen Source Connector** in **Confluent Cloud**, and you've applied SMTs to:

1. Use `itemid` as the Kafka **key** via `ValueToKey`.
2. Extract `orderunits` as the Kafka **value** via `ExtractField$Value`.

Now you're seeing Kafka records with keys like:

```
Struct{itemid=Item_3}
```

---

### ✅ Is This Expected?

Yes, this is **expected behavior** when:

- You use **`ValueToKey` SMT** to set the key from a field.
- You use a **structured converter** like `JsonConverter` or `AvroConverter` **with schemas enabled**.

Kafka Connect internally represents the key as a **structured object** (`Struct`) when schemas are enabled. This is why you see:

```
Struct{itemid=Item_3}
```

---

### 🔧 How to Get a Simpler Key Format (e.g., just `"Item_3"`)

If you want the key to appear as a **plain string** (not a `Struct`), you can:

#### Option 1: Use `StringConverter` for the key
```json
"key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter"
```

But this only works if the key is a **single string field**.

#### Option 2: Use `ExtractField$Key` SMT after `ValueToKey`
```json
"transforms": "setKey,extractKey,extractValue",
"transforms.setKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ValueToKey",
"transforms.setKey.fields": "itemid",
"transforms.extractKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Key",
"transforms.extractKey.field": "itemid",
"transforms.extractValue.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Value",
"transforms.extractValue.field": "orderunits"
```

This will:
- Set the key to the full struct `{itemid: "Item_3"}`
- Then extract just the `itemid` field as the final key

Resulting in a Kafka key like:
```
"Item_3"
```

---

### 🧠 Summary

| Behavior | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Struct{itemid=Item_3}` | `ValueToKey` with schema-enabled converter | Use `ExtractField$Key` or disable schemas |
| `"Item_3"` | Extracted string key | Use `ExtractField$Key` or `StringConverter` |
