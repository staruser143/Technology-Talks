# Azure Logic Apps vs NestJS Scheduler

* Using Azure Logic Apps instead of a NestJS scheduler is a viable and often preferred approach when you're working within Azure, especially if you want a cloud-native, no-code/low-code way to schedule, retry, and orchestrate background jobs.
* Let's walk through how Logic Apps can fully replace the NestJS scheduler in your event-driven enrollment application use case.

# ✅ Your Use Case Recap

## You want to:
* Periodically check enrollment applications submitted by brokers (not individuals/groups).
* Send reminder emails to brokers to get their signature (up to 5 times).
* Mark the application as PENDING if no response after 5 attempts.
* Possibly integrate with other systems (e.g., Lead Management).

### 🧭 Option: Use Azure Logic Apps Instead of NestJS Scheduler

## ✅ 1. High-Level Flow with Logic Apps

[Logic App Recurrence Trigger]
        |
        v
[Check MongoDB or Cosmos DB for apps needing broker signature]
        |
        v
[For each matching record]
        |
        v
[Send email via SMTP, SendGrid, or Outlook connector]
        |
        v
[Update retry count and nextAttemptAt]
        |
        v
[If retryCount > 5]
        |
        v
[Update status to PENDING]

## 🛠️ 2. Logic App Implementation Steps

* Step 1: Trigger Logic App on Schedule

Use Recurrence Trigger

E.g., every 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.


{
  "type": "Recurrence",
  "interval": 1,
  "frequency": "Hour"
}


---

Step 2: Query MongoDB / Cosmos DB

Use Azure Cosmos DB (Mongo API) or MongoDB connector to:

Filter applications like:


{
  "submittedBy": "BROKER",
  "signatureStatus": "PENDING",
  "retryCount": { "$lt": 5 },
  "nextAttemptAt": { "$lte": now }
}


---

Step 3: Loop Over Matching Applications

Use "For Each" loop in Logic App to:

Loop through each application record

Perform logic for each one



---

Step 4: Send Email

Use built-in connectors:

Outlook 365, SMTP, or SendGrid connector

Email template can be HTML or dynamic



---

Step 5: Update Retry Count and Timestamp

Update the record to:

retryCount += 1

nextAttemptAt = now + 24h (or another interval)

Use "Update document" action



---

Step 6: If Retry Count >= 5

Use a Condition block to check

If yes → Set status = "PENDING"

### ✅ 3. Pros of Using Logic Apps

Benefit                         	Why It Helps

✅ No infrastructure	               No scheduler service or pod needed
✅ Resilient retries	               Built-in retry policy, error handling
✅ Visual workflow	               Easier to update and monitor
✅ Native Azure integration	       Cosmos DB, Service Bus, SendGrid, etc.
✅ Monitoring	                       Integrated with Azure Monitor, alerts, logs

# 🧩 Optional Enhancements

# 🔁 Use Service Bus Instead of Mongo Polling

* If you don’t want to query Mongo repeatedly, push reminder tasks into a Service Bus Queue with scheduled delivery

Trigger Logic App from Service Bus Queue
---

### 🧠 Use Durable Functions (if you want code + logic flow)

* If your logic is complex and requires stateful workflows, consider Durable Functions.
