In an **event sourcing scenario** for the **Quoting domain**, choosing the right **Cosmos DB consistency levels** is critical to ensure **data consistency**, **performance**, and **scalability**. Letâ€™s break down the consistency levels for each operation:

---

### **1. Appending Events to the Event Store**
When appending events to the Event Store, you want to ensure that events are written **durably** and **consistently**.

#### **Recommended Consistency Level**: **Strong**
- **Why?**
  - Ensures that once an event is written, it is immediately visible to all readers.
  - Prevents scenarios where a subsequent read might return stale data or miss the newly appended event.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Higher latency compared to weaker consistency levels.
  - Suitable for critical operations where consistency is more important than performance.

#### **Alternative**: **Bounded Staleness**
- **Why?**
  - Provides a balance between consistency and performance.
  - Guarantees that reads are no more than a specified time or version behind the latest write.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Slightly lower consistency than Strong but better performance.

---

### **2. Reading from the Change Feed**
The **Change Feed** in Cosmos DB is designed to provide a **consistent and ordered stream of changes**. The consistency level for reading from the Change Feed depends on your requirements.

#### **Recommended Consistency Level**: **Session**
- **Why?**
  - Ensures that the Change Feed processor sees a consistent view of the data within the same session.
  - Suitable for most event-driven architectures where eventual consistency is acceptable.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Lower latency compared to Strong consistency.

#### **Alternative**: **Eventual**
- **Why?**
  - Provides the lowest latency and highest throughput.
  - Suitable for scenarios where slight staleness is acceptable.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Reads might return stale data.

---

### **3. Updating the Domain Data Store (Read Model)**
When updating the **domain data store** (e.g., a read model or projection), you want to ensure that the updates are consistent with the events being processed.

#### **Recommended Consistency Level**: **Session**
- **Why?**
  - Ensures that the read model is updated with a consistent view of the data.
  - Suitable for most scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Lower latency compared to Strong consistency.

#### **Alternative**: **Strong**
- **Why?**
  - Ensures that the read model is always up-to-date with the latest events.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Higher latency and lower throughput.

---

### **4. Resolving User Requests**
When resolving user requests (e.g., fetching the current state of a quote), you want to ensure that the data returned is **consistent** and **up-to-date**.

#### **Recommended Consistency Level**: **Session**
- **Why?**
  - Ensures that the user sees a consistent view of the data within the same session.
  - Suitable for most user-facing applications.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Lower latency compared to Strong consistency.

#### **Alternative**: **Strong**
- **Why?**
  - Ensures that the user always sees the latest data.
- **Trade-off**:
  - Higher latency and lower throughput.

### **5. Summary of Consistency Levels**

| **Operation**                     | **Recommended Consistency Level** | **Alternative**       |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Appending Events**              | Strong                            | Bounded Staleness     |
| **Reading from Change Feed**      | Session                           | Eventual              |
| **Updating Domain Data Store**    | Session                           | Strong                |
| **Resolving User Requests**       | Session                           | Strong                |

### **6. Key Considerations**

#### **a. Trade-offs Between Consistency and Performance**
- **Strong Consistency**:
  - Provides the highest level of consistency.
  - Higher latency and lower throughput.
  - Suitable for critical operations where consistency is paramount.

- **Session Consistency**:
  - Provides a balance between consistency and performance.
  - Ensures consistency within the same session.
  - Suitable for most scenarios in event sourcing.

- **Eventual Consistency**:
  - Provides the lowest latency and highest throughput.
  - Suitable for scenarios where slight staleness is acceptable.

#### **b. Use Case-Specific Requirements**
- For **appending events**, use **Strong** or **Bounded Staleness** to ensure durability and consistency.
- For **reading from the Change Feed**, use **Session** or **Eventual** to balance performance and consistency.
- For **updating the domain data store** and **resolving user requests**, use **Session** to ensure a consistent view of the data.

#### **c. Global Distribution**
- If your Cosmos DB is **globally distributed**, consider using **Bounded Staleness** or **Session** consistency to reduce latency across regions.
- Use **Strong** consistency only for critical operations that require the highest level of consistency.

### **7. Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Appending Events**
- **Consistency Level**: Strong
- **Reason**: Ensure that events are durably written and immediately visible.

#### **Scenario 2: Reading from Change Feed**
- **Consistency Level**: Session
- **Reason**: Balance performance and consistency for event-driven processing.

#### **Scenario 3: Updating Domain Data Store**
- **Consistency Level**: Session
- **Reason**: Ensure that the read model is updated with a consistent view of the data.

#### **Scenario 4: Resolving User Requests**
- **Consistency Level**: Session
- **Reason**: Provide a consistent view of the data to users with low latency.

### **8. Conclusion**
Choosing the right **Cosmos DB consistency levels** depends on your specific requirements for **consistency**, **performance**, and **scalability**. In the Quoting domain:
- Use **Strong** consistency for appending events to ensure durability.
- Use **Session** consistency for reading from the Change Feed, updating the domain data store, and resolving user requests to balance performance and consistency.
- Consider **Bounded Staleness** or **Eventual** consistency for scenarios where slight staleness is acceptable.

By carefully selecting the consistency levels for each operation, you can build a scalable, consistent, and performant event-sourcing system for the Quoting domain.
