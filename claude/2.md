I've updated the code to show three comprehensive methods for handling optional/missing fields in JSONPath:

**Method 1: Try-Catch**
- Catches `PathNotFoundException` when a field doesn't exist
- Best for: Individual field access with custom fallback logic
- Example: Trying to access `$.company.address` (doesn't exist in payload)

**Method 2: Configuration Options**
- `DEFAULT_PATH_LEAF_TO_NULL` - Returns null instead of throwing exception
- `SUPPRESS_EXCEPTIONS` - Silently handles all errors
- `ALWAYS_RETURN_LIST` - Returns empty list for missing fields
- Best for: Consistent behavior across many queries

**Method 3: Conditional Checks**
- Use filters `[?(@.field)]` to find only objects with specific fields
- Check parent object with `containsKey()`
- Use `getOrDefault()` for safe Map access
- Best for: When you only want items that have certain fields

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **For single fields**: Use try-catch or Configuration with `DEFAULT_PATH_LEAF_TO_NULL`
2. **For arrays/lists**: Use `SUPPRESS_EXCEPTIONS` or `ALWAYS_RETURN_LIST`
3. **For filtering**: Use JSONPath filters to exclude objects without required fields
4. **For production code**: Choose one strategy consistently across your application

The examples show accessing fields like `address`, `phone`, `website`, and `certifications` that don't exist in the payload, demonstrating how each method handles them differently.
