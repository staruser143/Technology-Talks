Spring Batch Migration Decision Matrix

Criteria	Azure VM (Lift & Shift)	Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)	Azure Spring Apps	Azure Container Apps	Azure Functions	Azure Batch	Azure Data Factory + Containers

Refactoring Effort	Minimal	Medium	Low to Medium	Medium	High	Medium to High	Medium
Job Duration	Long-running supported	Long-running supported	Moderate (under 30 mins ideal)	Short to Medium	Short (max 5-10 mins ideally)	Long or parallel jobs supported	Long-running supported
Execution Frequency	Scheduled	Scheduled / Event-driven	Scheduled	Event-driven / Scheduled	Event-driven / Scheduled	Scheduled	Pipeline Orchestration Supported
Compute Intensity	High supported	High supported	Moderate	Moderate	Low to Moderate	High supported	Moderate to High
Concurrency & Scalability	Manual	High (via pods)	Moderate	High	High	High	High
Cloud-native Goals	Low	High	Moderate	High	High	Moderate	High
Monitoring & Observability	Custom setup	Built-in / OpenTelemetry	App Insights Integration	App Insights / Dapr support	App Insights	Azure Monitor	App Insights + Data Factory Monitoring
CI/CD Integration	Script-based	Strong (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)	Strong	Strong	Strong	Good	Good
Best For	Minimal migration scenarios	Modernized, microservice-based jobs	Existing Spring Boot-based jobs	Stateless micro-batch jobs	Very short, event-triggered jobs	Heavy workloads, parallelism	ETL/Data movement with containerized jobs
Job Scheduling Support	Cron (OS-based)	Kubernetes CronJobs / Event Triggers	Spring Scheduler	Azure Scheduler, Event Grid	Timer Trigger	Native Scheduler	ADF Triggers
Cost Efficiency	Low (always-on VM)	Medium to High (depends on usage)	Medium	High (pay-per-use)	Very High (serverless)	High (pay-per-job)	High
Integration with Azure Services	Manual	Easy with service bindings	Native for Spring-based apps	Native via Dapr and bindings	Native	Native	Native

When to Use Each Option

Azure VM: Use only for quick lift-and-shift when you don’t want to change much initially.

AKS: Ideal for large-scale, containerized workloads or when adopting microservices.

Azure Spring Apps: Best for Spring Boot/Spring Batch apps when you want managed services without deep Kubernetes knowledge.

Azure Container Apps: Great for containerized batch jobs with event-driven triggers or short-run jobs.

Azure Functions: Only for lightweight, stateless, and quick jobs due to timeout limits.

Azure Batch: Suitable for heavy, parallel, or compute-intensive batch jobs.

Azure Data Factory + Containers: Perfect for orchestrated ETL workflows that include Spring Batch as part of the pipeline.
