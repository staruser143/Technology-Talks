Spring Batch is a lightweight, open-source framework designed for batch processing in Java. It is part of the Spring ecosystem and is typically used to handle large volumes of data in a robust, scalable, and efficient way. Batch processing involves reading data, processing it, and writing the output — often from/to databases, files, or messaging systems.

Key Concepts in Spring Batch

1. Job
A batch job represents an entire batch process and consists of one or more steps.


2. Step
A step is a phase in the job — it encapsulates the logic for reading, processing, and writing data. Each step is usually atomic.


3. ItemReader
Responsible for reading data from a source (like a CSV file, database, or queue).


4. ItemProcessor
Applies business logic or transformation to the data.


5. ItemWriter
Writes the processed data to a target (like a database or another file).


6. JobLauncher
Triggers the execution of a job.


7. JobRepository
Stores metadata about job executions, like start time, status, parameters, etc.


8. JobExecution & StepExecution
Represent the runtime information and state of the job and step executions respectively.

How Spring Batch Works: Flow Overview

1. Define a Job with one or more steps.


2. Each Step has:

An ItemReader (e.g., reads from a file),

An optional ItemProcessor (e.g., converts data),

An ItemWriter (e.g., writes to a database).



3. A JobLauncher is used to start the job with parameters.


4. Metadata is stored in a JobRepository for monitoring, restartability, and history.

Example Use Cases

Processing CSV/XML/JSON files

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations

Generating reports

Database migrations

Sending out notifications in batch

Simple Example

@Bean
public Job importUserJob(JobBuilderFactory jobs, Step step1) {
    return jobs.get("importUserJob")
               .incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer())
               .flow(step1)
               .end()
               .build();
}

@Bean
public Step step1(StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory, 
                  ItemReader<User> reader,
                  ItemProcessor<User, ProcessedUser> processor,
                  ItemWriter<ProcessedUser> writer) {
    return stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
                             .<User, ProcessedUser>chunk(10)
                             .reader(reader)
                             .processor(processor)
                             .writer(writer)
                             .build();
}

If you want, I can walk you through a sample use case like reading a CSV file, processing the data, and storing it in a database.
