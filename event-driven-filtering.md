## I am working on a requirement to support the users to select the plan based on responses they provide to questions. There would a page where the plans would be listed in the centre area. In the side-bar/left panel, there would be some questions for which the users can provide answers which would apply a filter to the plans displayed on the plan listing page. Based on the answers provided, plans would be recommended for the users. The user can repeat the process by further answering some more questions which would result in more recommended plans in the centra area.After the user has selected the plans, they should be persisted to the data store. How would I design/implement this using ReactJS as front-end and NestJS as backend

* This usecase combines user interaction, dynamic filtering, and backend integration!
* Step-by-step approach to design and implement the requirement using ReactJS for the frontend and NestJS for the backend:

---

### **Frontend (ReactJS)**

#### 1. **UI Structure**
- **Plan Listing Component**: A central component to display filtered and recommended plans.
- **Sidebar/Question Panel Component**: A left-side panel where users answer questions. Each question can be a form input (e.g., radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns).
- **Global State Management**: Use a state management library like Redux, Zustand, or React Context to manage the selected answers and recommended plans.

#### 2. **Data Flow**
- The answers from the sidebar are updated in the state.
- Based on the state, trigger a call to the backend to fetch filtered/recommended plans.
- Update the central plan listing area with the backend response.

#### 3. **Components Breakdown**
- **Question Panel**:
  - Render questions dynamically.
  - Capture user input and update the global state.
- **Plan Listing**:
  - Display the filtered/recommended plans based on the backend response.
- **Selection Summary**:
  - A section to allow users to confirm their selected plans and trigger saving.

#### 4. **API Integration**
Use `axios` or the Fetch API to call the backend with:
- User responses for filtering plans.
- Selected plans for persisting.

#### 5. **Interaction Handling**
- Debounce the API call when users provide answers to questions (to avoid excessive API calls).
- Show loading indicators while fetching plans.

### **Backend (NestJS)**

#### 1. **API Endpoints**
Design RESTful endpoints like:
- `POST /plans/filter`: Accepts user responses as a JSON payload and returns filtered plans.
- `POST /plans/selection`: Accepts selected plans and persists them.

#### 2. **Service Layer**
- Use a service to handle the logic of filtering/recommending plans based on responses.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  async filterPlans(userResponses: UserResponseDto): Promise<Plan[]> {
    const filters = this.constructFilters(userResponses);
    return this.planRepository.find(filters);
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Database Layer**
- **Schema Design**: Create collections/tables for:
  - `Plans` (Plan details, attributes for filtering).
  - `UserSelections` (To store the user's selected plans).
- Use appropriate indexing in MongoDB to make filtering efficient.

#### 4. **Business Logic for Filtering**
- Parse user responses to generate query filters (e.g., using MongoDB's `$and`, `$or`, and `$in` operators).
- Return recommended plans based on matching criteria.

#### 5. **Persisting Plans**
- Store the user's selected plans in a collection.
- Ensure data consistency by validating the selected plans against the existing records.

### **Integration**
1. **Frontend-Backend Communication**:
   - Use `POST` requests from ReactJS to interact with the NestJS endpoints.
2. **Real-Time Updates (Optional)**:
   - If we want real-time plan updates,we should use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) in NestJS with ReactJS.

---

### **High-Level Workflow**
1. User answers a question in the sidebar, and the input is updated in the frontend state.
2. ReactJS triggers an API call to the backend (`/plans/filter`) to fetch filtered plans.
3. Backend applies filtering logic and returns the matching plans.
4. Frontend displays the plans in the central area.
5. User selects a plan, and the frontend triggers an API call to `/plans/selection` to persist the choices.
