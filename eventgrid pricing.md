Azure Event Grid's pricing is primarily based on the number of operations. This means you pay for each action that Event Grid performs, rather than the amount of data that passes through it.
Here's a breakdown of what counts as an operation:
 * Event Ingress: This refers to the act of publishing an event to an Event Grid topic. So, each time your JavaScript app (or any other source) sends an event to Event Grid, it counts as one operation.
 * Subscription Delivery Attempts: When Event Grid tries to deliver an event to a subscriber (your JavaScript webhook), that's also an operation. If the delivery fails and Event Grid retries (according to your retry policy), each retry counts as a separate operation.
 * Management Calls: Any API calls you make to manage Event Grid resources (e.g., creating topics, subscriptions, etc.) are also counted as operations.
 * Filtering by Subject Suffix: If you use advanced filtering based on the subject suffix of events, this filtering action is also counted as an operation.
Does it include both ingress and egress?
Yes, in a way.
 * Ingress: Event ingress (publishing events) is definitely included in the pricing, as mentioned above.
 * Egress: While "egress" isn't explicitly mentioned, the cost of delivering events to subscribers is included in the "subscription delivery attempts" operation. So, you're paying for Event Grid to send the event out to your JavaScript app (or any other subscriber).
Free Grant:
Azure Event Grid provides a free grant of 100,000 operations per month. This allows you to experiment with the service and build basic event-driven applications without incurring costs.
Pricing Tiers:
Event Grid has different tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium, and Dedicated) with varying features and capabilities. The pricing per million operations may differ slightly between these tiers.
Key Points:
 * Pay-per-operation: You only pay for the actions Event Grid performs.
 * No data charges: You're not charged based on the size of the events or the amount of data transferred.
 * Free tier: The free grant helps you get started without cost.
 * Tiered pricing: Different tiers offer different features and pricing.
To estimate your costs:
 * Estimate Event Volume: How many events will your application publish per month?
 * Estimate Delivery Attempts: How many times will Event Grid attempt to deliver each event (including retries)?
 * Consider Management Calls: How many API calls will you make to manage Event Grid resources?
 * Factor in Filtering: If you use subject suffix filtering, include those operations as well.
 * Calculate Total Operations: Add up all the estimated operations.
 * Apply Pricing: Use the pricing per million operations for your chosen tier to calculate your estimated costs.
By understanding how Event Grid pricing works, you can accurately estimate your costs and optimize your event-driven architecture.
