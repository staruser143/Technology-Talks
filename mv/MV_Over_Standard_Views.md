Yes, using materialized views can be beneficial if you want to separate write and read operations in MongoDB. Here are some key points to consider:

### Materialized Views
- **Stored on Disk**: Materialized views store the results of an aggregation pipeline on disk, which can significantly improve read performance, especially for complex queries[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78070999/how-are-mongodbs-on-demand-materialized-views-on-demand-vs-their-standard-views)[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/).
- **Pre-computed Data**: Since the data is pre-computed and stored, read operations are faster as they don't need to re-run the aggregation pipeline each time[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/).
- **Indexing**: You can create indexes on materialized views, further enhancing read performance[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/).
- **Syncing**: You can use change streams to keep the materialized view in sync with the source collection, ensuring that the view reflects the latest data[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78070999/how-are-mongodbs-on-demand-materialized-views-on-demand-vs-their-standard-views).

### Standard Views
- **Computed on Read**: Standard views are computed on-the-fly when you query them. This means the aggregation pipeline runs every time you read from the view, which can be slower for complex queries[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78070999/how-are-mongodbs-on-demand-materialized-views-on-demand-vs-their-standard-views)[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/).
- **No Storage Overhead**: Since standard views are not stored on disk, they don't consume additional storage space[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78070999/how-are-mongodbs-on-demand-materialized-views-on-demand-vs-their-standard-views).
- **Indexing**: Standard views use the indexes of the underlying collection, but you cannot create, drop, or rebuild indexes directly on the view[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/).

### When to Use Materialized Views
- **High Read Performance**: If your application requires high read performance and you have complex queries, materialized views are a better choice.
- **Frequent Reads**: When the data is read frequently and the overhead of re-running the aggregation pipeline is significant.
- **Indexing Needs**: If you need to create specific indexes to optimize read queries.

### When to Use Standard Views
- **Storage Constraints**: If you want to save on storage space and the overhead of computing the view on read is acceptable.
- **Dynamic Data**: When the data changes frequently and you need the most up-to-date results without the need for syncing mechanisms.

In summary, if separating write and read operations is crucial for your application, materialized views offer better performance and flexibility for read-heavy workloads[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78070999/how-are-mongodbs-on-demand-materialized-views-on-demand-vs-their-standard-views)[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/).
