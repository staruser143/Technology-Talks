Yes, you can filter events in MongoDB Change Streams using an aggregation pipeline. This allows you to specify criteria for the events you want to monitor, such as changes to specific fields or certain types of operations.

### Example of Filtering Events

Here's an example of how to filter change events to monitor updates to a specific field using Node.js:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function monitorChanges() {
  const uri = 'your_mongodb_connection_string';
  const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const database = client.db('your_database_name');
    const collection = database.collection('your_collection_name');

    // Define the aggregation pipeline to filter events
    const pipeline = [
      {
        $match: {
          $and: [
            { "updateDescription.updatedFields.someField": { $exists: true } },
            { operationType: "update" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ];

    const changeStream = collection.watch(pipeline);

    changeStream.on('change', (change) => {
      console.log('Change detected:', change);
      // Execute your custom logic here
    });
  } finally {
    // Do not close the client to keep listening for changes
  }
}

monitorChanges().catch(console.error);
```

### Explanation:
1. **$match Stage**: Filters the change events to include only those where the `updateDescription.updatedFields.someField` exists and the operation type is `update`.
2. **Change Stream**: The `watch` method is used to create a change stream with the specified pipeline.

### Additional Filtering Options
You can filter events based on various criteria, such as:
- **Operation Type**: Filter by `insert`, `update`, `delete`, etc.
- **Specific Fields**: Monitor changes to specific fields using the `$exists` operator.
- **Document Content**: Use other aggregation operators to filter based on the content of the documents[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49621939/how-to-watch-for-changes-to-specific-fields-in-mongodb-change-stream).

By using these filtering options, you can tailor the change stream to monitor only the events that are relevant to your application.
