In MongoDB, there are two main types of views: **standard views** and **on-demand materialized views**. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

|       | Standard Views   | On-Demand Materialized Views   |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Computation** | Computed every time you read the view  |Pre-computed and stored on disk using the `$merge` or `$out` stages of an aggregation pipeline |
| **Storage** | Not stored on disk; they are virtual and only exist during the query execution.   | Stored on disk, allowing for faster read performance.|
| **Indexes** | Use the indexes of the underlying collection, but you cannot create, drop, or rebuild indexes directly on the view.   |You can create, drop, and rebuild indexes directly on the materialized view. |
| **Performance** |May have slower read performance, especially for complex aggregation pipelines, since they are computed on-the-fly   |Generally offer better read performance because the data is pre-computed and stored. |
| **Use Case** | Useful for saving storage space and providing aggregated data to specific user groups without granting access to the base collection.   | Ideal for scenarios where you need fast read access to pre-aggregated data, especially for complex and expensive computation|
