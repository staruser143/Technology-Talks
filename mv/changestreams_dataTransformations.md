Certainly! Here are some examples of data transformations you can perform using MongoDB Change Streams with an aggregation pipeline:

### 1. **Adding Computed Fields**
You can add new fields to the change events based on existing data.

#### Example:
```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $addFields: {
      totalPrice: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] }
    }
  }
];
```
This example adds a `totalPrice` field by multiplying the `quantity` and `price` fields.

### 2. **Filtering Specific Fields**
You can filter out unnecessary fields to reduce the size of the change events.

#### Example:
```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      productId: 1,
      totalPrice: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] }
    }
  }
];
```
This example projects only the `_id`, `productId`, and a computed `totalPrice` field.

### 3. **Grouping Data**
You can group change events to aggregate data.

#### Example:
```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$productId",
      totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" }
    }
  }
];
```
This example groups the change events by `productId` and calculates the total sales for each product.

### 4. **Joining Data from Another Collection**
You can join data from another collection to enrich the change events.

#### Example:
```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      localField: "productId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "productDetails"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$productDetails"
  }
];
```
This example joins the `products` collection to add product details to each change event.

### 5. **Conditional Transformations**
You can apply conditional logic to transform data based on specific conditions.

#### Example:
```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $addFields: {
      status: {
        $cond: { if: { $gte: ["$amount", 100] }, then: "High", else: "Low" }
      }
    }
  }
];
```
This example adds a `status` field that is set to "High" if the `amount` is greater than or equal to 100, otherwise "Low".

### Combining Transformations
You can combine multiple transformations in a single pipeline to achieve complex data processing.

#### Example:
```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $match: {
      operationType: "update"
    }
  },
  {
    $addFields: {
      totalPrice: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      localField: "productId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "productDetails"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$productDetails"
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      productId: 1,
      totalPrice: 1,
      "productDetails.name": 1
    }
  }
];
```
This example filters for update operations, adds a computed `totalPrice` field, joins product details, and projects the relevant fields.

By using these transformations, you can tailor the change events to meet your application's specific needs, making your data processing more efficient and effective.
