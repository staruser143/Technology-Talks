MongoDB Materialized Views

MongoDB Materialized Views are precomputed, stored query results that improve query performance by reducing the need for expensive real-time aggregations. They are typically created using the $merge stage in an Aggregation Pipeline, which writes the results of the aggregation into a separate collection.

Unlike standard views in MongoDB (which are virtual and recompute results at query time), materialized views persist data in a collection and need to be manually refreshed to stay up to date.

When to Use MongoDB Materialized Views

✅ Use Cases:

1. Precomputed Aggregations: When running frequent and expensive aggregation queries on large datasets (e.g., sum, count, avg).


2. Faster Read Performance: When queries involve complex joins ($lookup), filtering, and transformations.


3. Dashboards & Analytics: For real-time reporting where the data does not need to be updated instantly.


4. Data Denormalization: When you need to store pre-aggregated or transformed data to optimize retrieval.


5. Archiving Historical Data: Storing snapshots of past calculations while keeping the main dataset smaller.



❌ When NOT to Use:

1. Highly Dynamic Data: If the source data changes frequently and materialized views need frequent refreshing, it may not be worth it.


2. Storage Constraints: Materialized views take up additional disk space as they store redundant data.


3. Real-time Updates: If you need up-to-the-second accuracy, querying the source collection dynamically might be better.

How to Create a Materialized View in MongoDB

Using the $merge stage:

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $merge: { into: "customer_spending", whenMatched: "merge", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
]);

This creates a materialized view (customer_spending) that stores total spending per customer.

For refreshing, you must re-run the aggregation periodically (e.g., via a cron job or a scheduled trigger).
