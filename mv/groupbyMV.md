If you want to create a materialized view in MongoDB with group-by options, you can definitely do that using the aggregation framework. The `$group` stage is commonly used to group documents by a specified field and perform aggregations like sum, average, count, etc.

Here's an example of how you can create a materialized view with a group-by operation:

1. **Define the Aggregation Pipeline**: Use the `$group` stage to group documents and perform aggregations.
2. **Output the Results**: Use the `$merge` or `$out` stage to write the results to a new collection.

Here's a complete example:
```javascript
db.sourceCollection.aggregate([
   { $match: { status: "active" } }, // Optional: Filter documents
   { $group: { _id: "$category", totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" }, count: { $sum: 1 } } }, // Group by 'category'
   { $merge: { into: "materializedViewCollection", whenMatched: "merge", whenNotMatched: "insert" } } // Write results to 'materializedViewCollection'
])
```

In this example:
- The `$match` stage filters documents with an "active" status.
- The `$group` stage groups documents by the `category` field and calculates the total amount and count for each category.
- The `$merge` stage writes the results to a new collection called `materializedViewCollection`.

You can adjust the aggregation pipeline to fit your specific requirements. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
