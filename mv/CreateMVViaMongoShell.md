Yes, you can create materialized views in the MongoDB shell using the `$out` or `$merge` stages in an aggregation pipeline. Here's how you can do it:

### Example Using `$out` in MongoDB Shell

1. **Connect to MongoDB**:
   Open your MongoDB shell and connect to your database.

2. **Define and Execute the Aggregation Pipeline**:
   Use the `aggregate` method to define and execute your pipeline.

Here's an example that creates a materialized view by calculating the average score and writing the results to a new collection:

```javascript
db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    $set: {
      averageScore: { $avg: "$scores" }
    }
  },
  {
    $out: "materialized_view_collection"
  }
])
```

### Explanation:
1. **$set Stage**:
   - Adds a new field `averageScore` that calculates the average of the `scores` array.

2. **$out Stage**:
   - Writes the results of the aggregation pipeline to a new collection named `materialized_view_collection`.

### Example Using `$merge` in MongoDB Shell

If you prefer to use `$merge` for more flexibility, here's an example:

```javascript
db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$productId",
      totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" }
    }
  },
  {
    $merge: {
      into: "materialized_view_collection",
      on: "_id",
      whenMatched: "merge",
      whenNotMatched: "insert"
    }
  }
])
```

### Explanation:
1. **$group Stage**:
   - Groups the documents by `productId`.
   - Calculates the total sales for each product using the `$sum` operator.

2. **$merge Stage**:
   - **into**: Specifies the target collection (`materialized_view_collection`).
   - **on**: Specifies the field to match documents (`_id`).
   - **whenMatched**: Specifies the action to take when a matching document is found (`merge` updates the existing document).
   - **whenNotMatched**: Specifies the action to take when no matching document is found (`insert` adds a new document).

These examples show how to create materialized views directly in the MongoDB shell using both `$out` and `$merge` stages[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/)[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/core/materialized-views/).
