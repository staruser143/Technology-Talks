To create a materialized view using the `$out` stage in MongoDB, you can follow these steps. This example demonstrates how to use the MongoDB Atlas UI to create a materialized view:

### Steps to Create a Materialized View with `$out`

1. **Navigate to the Clusters Page**:
   - Go to the Clusters page for your project in the MongoDB Atlas UI.
   - Select your organization and project if they are not already displayed.

2. **Browse Collections**:
   - Click on "Browse Collections" for the cluster that contains your data.
   - Select the database and collection you want to work with.

3. **Aggregation Tab**:
   - Click on the "Aggregation" tab.

4. **Add Aggregation Stages**:
   - Click "Add Stage" and select the aggregation stages you need. For example, you might use `$set` to transform your data.

5. **Add the `$out` Stage**:
   - Add the `$out` stage to write the results to a new collection.

### Example Aggregation Pipeline with `$out`

Here's an example of an aggregation pipeline that creates a materialized view:

```json
[
  {
    "$set": {
      "averageScore": { "$avg": "$scores" }
    }
  },
  {
    "$out": "materialized_view_collection"
  }
]
```

### Explanation:
1. **$set Stage**:
   - Adds a new field `averageScore` that calculates the average of the `scores` array.

2. **$out Stage**:
   - Writes the results of the aggregation pipeline to a new collection named `materialized_view_collection`.

This pipeline will create a new collection with the transformed data, effectively creating a materialized view[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/)[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/materialized-views/).


Using the `$out` stage in MongoDB has several limitations you should be aware of:

### 1. **Collection Replacement**
- **Behavior**: The `$out` stage replaces the entire target collection with the results of the aggregation pipeline. This means any existing data in the target collection will be lost[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/reference/operator/aggregation/out/).

### 2. **Sharded Collections**
- **Limitation**: The `$out` stage cannot write results to a sharded collection. If you need to output to a sharded collection, you should use the `$merge` stage instead[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/reference/operator/aggregation/out/).

### 3. **Capped Collections**
- **Limitation**: The `$out` stage cannot write results to a capped collection. Capped collections have a fixed size and do not support the dynamic nature of the `$out` stage[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/reference/operator/aggregation/out/).

### 4. **Atlas Search Indexes**
- **Limitation**: If you modify a collection with an Atlas Search index using the `$out` stage, you must delete and re-create the search index. This can be cumbersome if you frequently update the collection[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/reference/operator/aggregation/out/).

### 5. **Resource Usage**
- **Consideration**: The `$out` stage can be resource-intensive, especially for large datasets. It requires sufficient disk space and can impact performance if not managed properly[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33911573/when-do-i-absolutely-need-the-out-operator-in-mongodb-aggregation).

### 6. **Pipeline Position**
- **Requirement**: The `$out` stage must be the last stage in the aggregation pipeline. This limits the flexibility of the pipeline design[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/reference/operator/aggregation/out/).

### 7. **Document Size**
- **Limitation**: While the `$out` stage allows for result sets of any size, the individual documents must still adhere to MongoDB's BSON document size limit (16MB)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33911573/when-do-i-absolutely-need-the-out-operator-in-mongodb-aggregation).

### Example Scenario
If you need to create a materialized view but want to avoid some of these limitations, consider using the `$merge` stage, which offers more flexibility, such as writing to sharded collections and merging documents instead of replacing the entire collection.
