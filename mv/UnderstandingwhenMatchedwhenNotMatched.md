Yes, the whenMatched and whenNotMatched options in the $merge stage of MongoDB's aggregation framework work similarly to an upsert operation, but they provide more granular control over how existing and new documents are handled when updating a materialized view.

Understanding whenMatched and whenNotMatched

When using $merge, MongoDB determines whether a document in the aggregation result matches an existing document in the target collection based on the _id field (or a custom on field if specified).

ðŸ”¹ whenMatched (If a matching document exists)

Defines what to do when a document from the aggregation matches an existing document in the target collection.

Options:

"merge" â†’ Updates the existing document with new fields (default behavior, like an update).

"replace" â†’ Replaces the entire document with the new one.

"fail" â†’ Throws an error if a match is found.

"keepExisting" â†’ Keeps the existing document as is (ignores updates).

"pipeline" â†’ Allows applying a transformation pipeline to modify the existing document before merging.



ðŸ”¹ whenNotMatched (If no match is found)

Defines what to do when a document does not exist in the target collection.

Options:

"insert" â†’ Inserts the new document (default behavior, like an insert).

"discard" â†’ Ignores the new document and does not insert it.

"fail" â†’ Throws an error if no match is found.

Example: Using $merge for a Materialized View

Let's say we have an orders collection:

{ "_id": 1, "customerId": 100, "amount": 50 }
{ "_id": 2, "customerId": 100, "amount": 70 }
{ "_id": 3, "customerId": 101, "amount": 30 }

We want to create a materialized view that stores total spending per customer:

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { 
    $merge: { 
      into: "customer_spending", 
      on: "_id", 
      whenMatched: "merge", 
      whenNotMatched: "insert"
    } 
  }
]);

How It Works:

If a customer already exists in customer_spending, their totalSpent is updated (merged).

If a customer does not exist, a new record is inserted.

Comparison to Upsert

Key Differences:

$merge provides more control than upsert, allowing replacements, ignoring updates, or applying transformations.

$merge operates at the aggregation level, while upsert is used with individual updateOne or updateMany operations.

Best Practices

Use whenMatched: "merge" for incremental updates in a materialized view.

Use whenMatched: "replace" if you need complete data replacement.

Use whenNotMatched: "discard" to prevent inserting new documents.

Schedule re-execution of the aggregation to refresh the materialized view periodically.
