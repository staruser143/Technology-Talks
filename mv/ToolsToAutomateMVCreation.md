Using scripts to automate the creation and maintenance of materialized views (MVs) in a production environment is a common and effective approach. However, there are also other methods and tools that can help automate this process without relying solely on custom scripts.

### Using Scripts
- **Flexibility**: Scripts allow you to customize the creation, refresh, and maintenance processes according to your specific requirements.
- **Scheduling**: You can use cron jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run scripts at regular intervals, ensuring that your materialized views are updated as needed.
- **Example**: A Node.js or Python script that connects to MongoDB, runs the aggregation pipeline, and updates the materialized view.

### Using MongoDB Tools and Features
- **MongoDB Atlas**: MongoDB Atlas provides built-in tools for managing and automating various database tasks, including materialized views. You can use Atlas Triggers to automate the refresh of materialized views based on specific events or schedules[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50302979/create-materialised-view-without-data).
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Use the aggregation framework with `$merge` or `$out` stages to create and update materialized views. These stages can be incorporated into scripts or run directly from the MongoDB shell[2](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3046-ahmed.pdf).

### Example Using MongoDB Atlas Triggers
MongoDB Atlas Triggers can automate the execution of aggregation pipelines to refresh materialized views. Here's a basic example of how to set up a trigger:

1. **Create a Trigger**:
   - Go to the Triggers section in MongoDB Atlas.
   - Create a new trigger and set the event source (e.g., a specific collection).

2. **Define the Trigger Logic**:
   - Write the logic to execute the aggregation pipeline that updates the materialized view.

### Example Trigger Logic
```javascript
exports = function(changeEvent) {
  const collection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("your_database_name").collection("your_collection_name");

  const pipeline = [
    {
      $group: {
        _id: "$productId",
        totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" }
      }
    },
    {
      $merge: {
        into: "materialized_view_collection",
        on: "_id",
        whenMatched: "merge",
        whenNotMatched: "insert"
      }
    }
  ];

  return collection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray();
};
```

### Summary
While scripts provide flexibility and control, using MongoDB Atlas Triggers or other built-in tools can simplify the automation process and reduce the need for custom code. Both approaches have their advantages, and the best choice depends on your specific requirements and environment[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50302979/create-materialised-view-without-data)[2](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3046-ahmed.pdf).
