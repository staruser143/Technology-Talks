Yes, you should create indexes on a materialized view in MongoDB, just like you would for a normal collection. Since materialized views are stored as regular collections, they do not automatically inherit indexes from the source collection.

🔹 Why Create Indexes on Materialized Views?

✅ Improve Query Performance: Indexes help speed up lookups, especially when querying aggregated or transformed data.
✅ Efficient Filtering & Sorting: Queries on materialized views can use indexes for fast access.
✅ Optimize Joins & Lookups: If the view is used in $lookup operations, indexes enhance performance.
✅ Reduce Full Collection Scans: Without indexes, queries on the materialized view may scan all documents.

🛠️ How to Create Indexes on a Materialized View

Since a materialized view is stored as a normal MongoDB collection, you can create indexes using the standard createIndex() method.

Example 1: Creating an Index on a Materialized View

You have a materialized view customer_sales, which stores total sales per customer from an orders collection.

📌 Create an Index on customerId for Faster Queries

db.customer_sales.createIndex({ _id: 1 });

✅ Effect: Queries like db.customer_sales.find({ _id: "C123" }) will be faster.

📌 Create a Compound Index on totalSpent for Sorting

db.customer_sales.createIndex({ totalSpent: -1 });

✅ Effect: Queries like db.customer_sales.find().sort({ totalSpent: -1 }) will be optimized.

Example 2: Creating an Index for a Time-Based Materialized View

You have a monthly_sales materialized view that stores total sales per month.

📌 Create an Index on Month for Faster Filtering

db.monthly_sales.createIndex({ _id: 1 });

✅ Effect: Queries like db.monthly_sales.find({ _id: "2024-03" }) will be efficient.

📌 Create an Expiring Index to Auto-Delete Old Records

db.monthly_sales.createIndex({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 2592000 });  // 30 days expiration

✅ Effect: Old records are automatically deleted after 30 days.

📌 When to Create Indexes on a Materialized View?

✅ If you frequently query the materialized view
✅ If the view has large data and needs efficient lookups
✅ If queries filter by specific fields (find(), sort(), lookup())
✅ If a field is used in aggregations or joins

❌ Avoid creating too many indexes—each index increases write overhead when updating the materialized view.
