Yes, you can set up triggers in MongoDB Atlas that execute both on a schedule and by monitoring a collection. However, you will need to create two separate triggers: one for the scheduled execution and one for monitoring the collection. Each trigger will be linked to the same function or different functions, depending on your requirements.

### Steps to Create Both Triggers

#### 1. **Scheduled Trigger**
This trigger will execute at regular intervals based on a CRON expression.

1. **Navigate to the Triggers Page**:
   - Go to the MongoDB Atlas UI.
   - Select your organization and project.
   - In the sidebar, click on **Triggers** under the **Services** heading.

2. **Add a New Trigger**:
   - Click on **Add Trigger**.
   - Select **Scheduled Trigger** as the trigger type.

3. **Configure the Trigger**:
   - **Name**: Give your trigger a name.
   - **Function**: Select or create the function that the trigger will execute.
   - **Schedule**: Define the schedule using a CRON expression (e.g., `*/5 * * * *` for every 5 minutes).

4. **Save the Trigger**:
   - Click **Save** to create the trigger.

#### 2. **Database Trigger**
This trigger will execute when a specified event occurs in a linked MongoDB collection.

1. **Add a New Trigger**:
   - Click on **Add Trigger**.
   - Select **Database Trigger** as the trigger type.

2. **Configure the Trigger**:
   - **Name**: Give your trigger a name.
   - **Event Source**: Select the collection and the type of events to monitor (e.g., insert, update, delete).
   - **Function**: Select or create the function that the trigger will execute.

3. **Save the Trigger**:
   - Click **Save** to create the trigger.

### Example Function
Here's an example of a function that could be executed by both triggers to update a materialized view:

```javascript
exports = function(changeEvent) {
  const collection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("your_database_name").collection("your_collection_name");

  const pipeline = [
    {
      $group: {
        _id: "$productId",
        totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" }
      }
    },
    {
      $merge: {
        into: "materialized_view_collection",
        on: "_id",
        whenMatched: "merge",
        whenNotMatched: "insert"
      }
    }
  ];

  return collection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray();
};
```

### Summary
By setting up both a scheduled trigger and a database trigger, you can ensure that your materialized view is updated both at regular intervals and in response to changes in the monitored collection[1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/scheduled-triggers/)[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/)[3](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/database-triggers/).
