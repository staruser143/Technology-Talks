Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
Title: Event Store Implementation using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API
Status: Approved
Date: 2024-07-26
Context:
We are building an event-sourced system.  A core component of this system is the event store, responsible for persisting and retrieving events in the order they occurred.  We need to choose a suitable database technology for this purpose.  Key requirements for the event store include:
 * Ordered storage: Events must be stored and retrieved in chronological order.
 * Scalability and Performance: The event store must handle a high volume of writes and reads with low latency.
 * Schema Flexibility: The event schema may evolve over time, so schema flexibility is important.
 * Cost-effectiveness: The solution should be cost-efficient for our expected workload.
 * Managed Service:  Preferably a managed service to reduce operational overhead.
Decision:
We will use Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API as the event store for our event sourcing system.
Rationale:
 * Ordered storage: Azure Cosmos DB guarantees ordered writes within a partition. We can leverage this by partitioning our event stream based on aggregate ID.  This ensures events for a single aggregate are stored and retrieved in order.
 * Scalability and Performance: Azure Cosmos DB offers excellent scalability and performance through its distributed architecture.  It allows us to scale throughput and storage independently.  The NoSQL API provides low-latency access to data.
 * Schema Flexibility: The NoSQL API is schema-less, making it ideal for storing events with varying structures.  We can easily accommodate changes to event schemas without migrations.
 * Cost-effectiveness: Azure Cosmos DB's pay-as-you-go pricing model allows us to optimize costs based on our actual usage.  We can fine-tune throughput and storage to meet our needs.
 * Managed Service: Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed service, reducing the operational burden on our team.
Alternatives Considered:
 * Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API:
   * Pros: Offers compatibility with MongoDB drivers and tools, which could potentially simplify development if the team has existing MongoDB expertise.
   * Cons:  While offering a familiar API, the underlying storage and query engine is still Azure Cosmos DB.  The compatibility layer might introduce performance overhead.  It doesn't directly address the ordered storage requirement as efficiently as the NoSQL API with proper partitioning.
 * MongoDB Atlas:
   * Pros:  A popular and mature NoSQL database. Offers a managed service option.
   * Cons:  Requires managing a separate MongoDB Atlas cluster.  While it offers scalability, integrating it with the rest of our Azure-based infrastructure would add complexity.  Cost considerations were also a factor, as Azure Cosmos DB's integration with other Azure services offered potential cost benefits.  Ordered storage needs to be handled via application-level logic.
Consequences:
 * Positive:  Leveraging Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API provides a scalable, performant, and cost-effective solution for our event store.  Its schema flexibility and managed nature minimize development and operational overhead.
 * Negative:  We need to ensure proper partitioning by aggregate ID to guarantee ordered events.  This requires careful design and implementation.  We will need to use the NoSQL API and its associated SDKs.  Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB's specific features and best practices is essential.
