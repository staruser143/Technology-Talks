Your current approach â€” using field names like `Object.Property.Index` â€” works well for **moderately nested JSON** with arrays at the top level. However, for **deeply nested structures** (e.g., arrays inside objects inside arrays), this strategy needs to be extended to remain generic.

### ðŸ§  Challenges with Deeply Nested JSON
Consider this JSON:
```json
{
  "PrimaryApplicant": {
    "FName": "Sridhar",
    "Dependents": [
      {
        "FName": "Ravi",
        "Education": {
          "School": "ABC School",
          "Grades": [
            {"Year": "2020", "Score": "A"},
            {"Year": "2021", "Score": "B"}
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To map this, you'd need field names like:
- `PrimaryApplicant.FName.1`
- `PrimaryApplicant.Dependents.FName.1`
- `PrimaryApplicant.Dependents.Education.School.1`
- `PrimaryApplicant.Dependents.Education.Grades.Year.1.1`
- `PrimaryApplicant.Dependents.Education.Grades.Score.1.1`

Here, the last two fields imply:
- First dependent (`.1`)
- First grade entry (`.1`)

### âœ… Making the Approach Generic

#### **1. Use Recursive JSON Path Resolution**
Build a recursive function that:
- Parses field names like `A.B.C.D.2.1`
- Resolves them into nested JSON lookups:
  - `A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D[1][0]`

#### **2. Field Name Parsing Logic**
- Treat numeric segments as array indices.
- Treat string segments as object keys.

#### **3. Java Implementation Strategy**
You can:
- Split the field name by `.`
- Traverse the JSON tree using Jackson (`JsonNode`)
- Use a helper method like:

```java
public static JsonNode resolveJsonPath(JsonNode root, String[] pathParts) {
    JsonNode current = root;
    for (String part : pathParts) {
        if (current == null) return null;
        if (part.matches("\\d+")) {
            int index = Integer.parseInt(part) - 1;
            if (current.isArray() && index < current.size()) {
                current = current.get(index);
            } else {
                return null;
            }
        } else {
            current = current.get(part);
        }
    }
    return current;
}
```

Then use:
```java
String[] parts = fieldName.split("\\.");
JsonNode valueNode = resolveJsonPath(jsonRoot, parts);
if (valueNode != null && valueNode.isValueNode()) {
    field.setValue(valueNode.asText());
}
```

### ðŸ§© Summary

| Feature | Supported? | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Flat JSON | âœ… | Works out of the box |
| Arrays in top-level objects | âœ… | Already supported |
| Nested arrays inside objects | âœ… | With recursive path resolution |
| Deeply nested mixed structures | âœ… | With enhanced parsing logic |

Would you like me to generate a complete Java class with this recursive logic and PDFBox integration? I can also include a sample JSON and simulate field names to test it.
