Here is the generated **custom mapping file** that links specific JSON paths to PDF field names:

### üßæ Example Entries from `mapping.json`
```json
{
  "PrimaryApplicant.FName": "First_Name_Field",
  "PrimaryApplicant.LName": "Last_Name_Field",
  "PrimaryApplicant.DOB": "Date_Of_Birth_Field",
  "Dependent[0].FName": "Dependent1_First_Name",
  "Dependent[0].LName": "Dependent1_Last_Name",
  "Dependent[0].Education.School": "Dependent1_School",
  "Dependent[0].Education.Grades[0].Year": "Dependent1_Grade1_Year",
  "Dependent[0].Education.Grades[0].Score": "Dependent1_Grade1_Score",
  ...
}
```

This file is compatible with the hybrid Java class we generated earlier. You can now use both convention-based and custom mappings seamlessly.

Would you like help integrating this into a Maven project or testing it with a real PDF template?
