Yes ‚Äî if the **PDF field names do not follow any predictable pattern** or **do not align with the JSON structure**, then you will need a **custom mapping configuration** to bridge the gap.

### üß© Why a Mapping Config Is Necessary

When field names differ, there's no way to infer the relationship between JSON keys and PDF fields programmatically. For example:

#### JSON:
```json
{
  "PrimaryApplicant": {
    "FName": "Sridhar",
    "LName": "Balasubramanian"
  }
}
```

#### PDF Field Names:
```
First_Name_Field
Last_Name_Field
```

There's no way to know that:
- `PrimaryApplicant.FName` ‚Üí `First_Name_Field`
- `PrimaryApplicant.LName` ‚Üí `Last_Name_Field`

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: Use a Mapping File

You can define a mapping like this in JSON:
```json
{
  "PrimaryApplicant.FName": "First_Name_Field",
  "PrimaryApplicant.LName": "Last_Name_Field"
}
```

Or in YAML:
```yaml
PrimaryApplicant.FName: First_Name_Field
PrimaryApplicant.LName: Last_Name_Field
```

Then your code can:
1. Flatten the JSON.
2. Look up each flattened key in the mapping.
3. Fill the corresponding PDF field.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hybrid Strategy

You can also combine both approaches:
- Use **dynamic mapping** for fields that follow conventions.
- Use **custom config** for exceptions or legacy templates.

Would you like a Java class that supports both dynamic and config-based mapping? I can generate that for you with a sample config file.
