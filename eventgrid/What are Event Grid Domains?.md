# What are Azure Event Grid Domain?
* An **Azure Event Grid domain** is a way to manage multiple event topics under a single endpoint. 
* Think of it as a meta-topic that can contain thousands of individual topics related to the same application. 
* This setup allows you to publish events to a single endpoint, and then route those events to the appropriate topic within the domain[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains).

### When to Use Azure Event Grid Domains:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> <b>Multitenant Architectures</b></th>
    <td>If you have a multitenant application where each tenant needs to receive specific events, an event domain can help you manage this efficiently. Each tenant can be represented as a topic within the domain[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains).</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><b>Scalability</b></th>
    <td>When you need to manage a large number of topics and subscriptions. Event domains can support up to 100,000 topics, each with up to 500 subscriptions[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains-use-cases).</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th><b>Simplified Management</b></th>
    <td>Instead of managing individual topics, you can manage them collectively through the domain. This includes handling authentication and authorization using Azure role-based access control (RBAC)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains).</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th><b>Partitioning</b></th>
    <td>If you need to partition your events for different business units, customers, or applications, event domains provide a structured way to do this without managing each topic individually[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains).
.</td>
  </tr>

#### Examples of use cases for Azure Event Grid domains:

|       | Scenario   | Solution  |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **Multitenant Applications** | You run a company like Contoso Construction Machinery, which manufactures heavy machinery and provides real-time updates to customers about equipment maintenance, system health, and contract updates.    | Use an event domain to represent your company as a single Event Grid entity. Each customer is represented as a topic within the domain. This allows you to publish all customer events to a single endpoint, and Event Grid ensures each topic only receives events relevant to its tenant[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains-use-cases).   |
| **High Subscription Needs** | You have an Azure Blob Storage system topic but need more than 500 event subscriptions, which exceeds the limit for a single system topic.  | Create an event domain that supports up to 100,000 topics, each with up to 500 subscriptions. This setup allows you to scale your event subscriptions significantly. For example, an Azure Function can receive events from Blob Storage, enrich them, and publish them to the appropriate domain topic[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains-use-cases).   |
| **Partitioning Events** | You need to partition events for different business units, customers, or applications | Use an event domain to manage authentication and authorization for each topic. This ensures that each business unit or customer only has access to their specific events, simplifying management and enhancing security[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-domains).  |
| **Decoupling Microservices** | You have a microservices architecture and need to decouple services to improve scalability and maintainability.     | Use Event Grid as a mediator to handle events between microservices. An event domain can help manage the flow of events, ensuring each microservice only processes relevant events[3](https://dev.to/dazevedo/azure-event-grid-simplifying-event-driven-architectures-318l).   |



Azure Event Grid domains are powerful, but they aren't always necessary. Here are some scenarios where you might not need to use event domains:

|       | Scenario   | Example  |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **Simple Event Routing** | If your application only needs to route events to a few endpoints or topics, using individual Event Grid topics might be simpler and more cost-effective.   | A small application that only needs to send events to a couple of services, like a web app and a database   |
| **Low Subscription Needs** |  If you don't need more than 500 event subscriptions, you can use system topics or custom topics without the complexity of managing an event domain.  |An application that only requires a few event subscriptions for monitoring and alerting purposes   |
| **Broadcast Scenarios** | Event domains are not designed for broadcasting the same event to multiple topics. If you need to broadcast events, consider using a different approach, such as Azure Service Bus or a single Event Grid topic with multiple subscriptions.  |  Sending a notification to all users of an application simultaneously.   |
| **Simple Authentication and Authorization** |If your authentication and authorization requirements are straightforward, managing individual topics might be easier.   | An internal application where all services have the same access level and there are no complex security requirements.   |
