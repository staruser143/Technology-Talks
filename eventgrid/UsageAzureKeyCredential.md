The `AzureKeyCredential` class is used to authenticate the `EventGridPublisherClient` when publishing events to an Azure Event Grid topic. Here's a breakdown of its usage:

### Purpose of `AzureKeyCredential`:
1. **Authentication**:
   - **Scenario**: You need to securely authenticate your client to the Event Grid service.
   - **Solution**: `AzureKeyCredential` uses an access key to authenticate the client, ensuring that only authorized clients can publish events[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/azure/eventgrid-readme?view=azure-node-latest).

2. **Simplified Credential Management**:
   - **Scenario**: Managing credentials securely without hardcoding them in your application.
   - **Solution**: By storing the access key in environment variables and using `AzureKeyCredential`, you can keep your credentials secure and easily rotate them when needed[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/azure/eventgrid-readme?view=azure-node-latest).

### Example Usage in Code:
In the provided NestJS example, `AzureKeyCredential` is used to create an instance of `EventGridPublisherClient`:
```typescript
import { EventGridPublisherClient, AzureKeyCredential } from '@azure/eventgrid';

@Injectable()
export class EventGridService {
  private client: EventGridPublisherClient;

  constructor() {
    const endpoint = process.env.EVENT_GRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT;
    const accessKey = process.env.EVENT_GRID_ACCESS_KEY;
    this.client = new EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(accessKey));
  }

  async publishEvent(event: any) {
    const events = [
      {
        id: '1',
        eventType: 'MyApp.Events.SampleEvent',
        subject: 'myapp/vehicles/motorcycles',
        eventTime: new Date(),
        data: event,
        dataVersion: '1.0',
      },
    ];

    await this.client.sendEvents(events);
  }
}
```
In this example:
- The `AzureKeyCredential` is instantiated with the access key retrieved from environment variables.
- The `EventGridPublisherClient` uses this credential to authenticate and send events to the Event Grid topic[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/azure/eventgrid-readme?view=azure-node-latest).
