Yes, you can use either system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities with Azure Event Grid, depending on your specific needs and scenarios. Hereâ€™s a comparison to help you decide which one to use:

### System-Assigned Managed Identities:
- **Lifecycle**: Tied to the lifecycle of the Azure resource (e.g., VM, App Service). When the resource is deleted, the identity is also deleted automatically[1](https://blog.johnfolberth.com/azure-managed-identities-user-vs-system-assigned/).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where each resource needs its own unique identity and you want the identity to be automatically managed.
- **Example**: A single Azure Function that needs to authenticate to Azure Event Grid to publish events.

### User-Assigned Managed Identities:
- **Lifecycle**: Independent of the Azure resource lifecycle. The identity can be assigned to multiple resources and persists even if the resources are deleted[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations).
- **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios where multiple resources need to share the same identity, or when you want to manage the identity separately from the resources.
- **Example**: Multiple Azure Functions or VMs that need to share the same identity to publish or subscribe to events in Azure Event Grid.

### Key Differences:
1. **Reusability**:
   - **System-Assigned**: One identity per resource.
   - **User-Assigned**: One identity can be shared across multiple resources[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations).

2. **Management**:
   - **System-Assigned**: Automatically managed by Azure, simplifying lifecycle management.
   - **User-Assigned**: Requires manual management but offers more flexibility[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations).

3. **Role Assignments**:
   - **System-Assigned**: Role assignments are tied to the resource and cannot be pre-configured.
   - **User-Assigned**: Role assignments can be pre-configured and managed independently[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations).

### Example Terraform Configuration for Both Identities:

#### System-Assigned Managed Identity:
```hcl
resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  name                       = "example-function"
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
  ...
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "eventgrid_sender" {
  principal_id   = azurerm_function_app.example.identity.principal_id
  role_definition_name = "EventGrid Data Sender"
  scope          = azurerm_eventgrid_topic.example.id
}
```

#### User-Assigned Managed Identity:
```hcl
resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "example" {
  name                = "example-identity"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
}

resource "azurerm_function_app" "example" {
  name                       = "example-function"
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  identity {
    type         = "UserAssigned"
    identity_ids = [azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.id]
  }
  ...
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "eventgrid_sender" {
  principal_id   = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.principal_id
  role_definition_name = "EventGrid Data Sender"
  scope          = azurerm_eventgrid_topic.example.id
}
```
