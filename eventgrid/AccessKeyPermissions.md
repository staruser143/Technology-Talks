Yes, the access key used with `AzureKeyCredential` must have the necessary permissions to publish events to the Azure Event Grid topic. This access key is typically generated when you create the Event Grid topic and is used to authenticate and authorize the client to send events.

### Key Points:
1. **Access Key Permissions**:
   - **Scenario**: The access key must be associated with the Event Grid topic to allow publishing events.
   - **Solution**: The key provides the necessary permissions to authenticate the client and authorize event publishing[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/authenticate-with-access-keys-shared-access-signatures).

2. **Obtaining the Access Key**:
   - **Scenario**: You need to retrieve the access key for your Event Grid topic.
   - **Solution**: You can obtain the access key from the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/get-access-keys).

### Example:
- **Azure Portal**:
  - Navigate to your Event Grid topic in the Azure portal.
  - Go to the **Access keys** section.
  - Copy one of the access keys to use with `AzureKeyCredential`.

- **Azure CLI**:
  ```bash
  az eventgrid topic key list --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <TOPIC_NAME>
  ```

- **Azure PowerShell**:
  ```powershell
  Get-AzEventGridTopicKey -ResourceGroup <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -Name <TOPIC_NAME>
  ```

### Using the Access Key in Code:
In your NestJS service, you use the access key with `AzureKeyCredential` to authenticate the `EventGridPublisherClient`:
```typescript
import { EventGridPublisherClient, AzureKeyCredential } from '@azure/eventgrid';

@Injectable()
export class EventGridService {
  private client: EventGridPublisherClient;

  constructor() {
    const endpoint = process.env.EVENT_GRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT;
    const accessKey = process.env.EVENT_GRID_ACCESS_KEY;
    this.client = new EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(accessKey));
  }

  async publishEvent(event: any) {
    const events = [
      {
        id: '1',
        eventType: 'MyApp.Events.SampleEvent',
        subject: 'myapp/vehicles/motorcycles',
        eventTime: new Date(),
        data: event,
        dataVersion: '1.0',
      },
    ];

    await this.client.sendEvents(events);
  }
}
```
