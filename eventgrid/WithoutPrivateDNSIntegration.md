If you don't set up private DNS integration for your Azure Event Grid topic, the traffic might still be routed via the public internet, even if you have a private endpoint configured. This is because DNS queries for the Event Grid topic's endpoint would resolve to its public IP address instead of the private IP address assigned to the private endpoint[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/configure-private-endpoints)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/mqtt-configure-private-endpoints).

### Key Points:
1. **Without Private DNS Integration**:
   - **Scenario**: DNS queries for the Event Grid topic resolve to the public IP address.
   - **Consequence**: Traffic may traverse the public internet, potentially exposing it to security risks[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/configure-private-endpoints).

2. **With Private DNS Integration**:
   - **Scenario**: DNS queries for the Event Grid topic resolve to the private IP address.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures that traffic stays within your virtual network, enhancing security and reducing exposure to the public internet[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/configure-private-endpoints).

### Example:
- **Internal Applications**: If you have an internal application that needs to securely publish events to an Event Grid topic, setting up private DNS integration ensures that all DNS queries are resolved within the VNet, keeping the traffic private and secure.
