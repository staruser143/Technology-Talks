# Creating Event Grid Topic
Creating an Azure Event Grid Topic is straightforward. Here are the steps to do it using the Azure portal:

### Steps to Create an Event Grid Topic:

1. **Sign in to Azure Portal**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Register the Event Grid Resource Provider** (if not already registered):
   - In the left menu, select **Subscriptions**.
   - Select your subscription from the list.
   - Under **Settings**, select **Resource providers**.
   - Search for `Microsoft.EventGrid` and ensure its status is **Registered**. If not, select it and click **Register**.

3. **Create a Custom Topic**:
   - In the search bar at the top, type **Event Grid Topics** and select it from the drop-down list.
   - Click on **+ Create** on the Event Grid Topics page.

4. **Basics Page**:
   - Select your **Azure subscription**.
   - Choose an existing **resource group** or create a new one.
   - Provide a unique name for the custom topic.
   - Select a **location** for the Event Grid topic.
   - Click **Next: Networking**.

5. **Networking Page**:
   - Choose whether to allow public access or restrict access to specific IP addresses.
   - If needed, configure a private endpoint.
   - Click **Next: Security**.

6. **Security Page**:
   - Optionally, enable a system-assigned managed identity for your topic.
   - Click **Next: Tags**.

7. **Tags Page**:
   - Optionally, add tags to organize your resources.
   - Click **Next: Review + create**.

8. **Review + Create**:
   - Review your settings and click **Create** to create the Event Grid topic.

Once the topic is created, you can start publishing events to it and set up event subscriptions to route those events to various endpoints[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/create-custom-topic).


## Location Property of Event Grid Topic
The **location property** of an Azure Event Grid topic specifies the Azure region where the topic is created and hosted. This is important for several reasons:

1. **Latency**: Choosing a location close to your event sources and subscribers can reduce latency, ensuring faster event delivery.
2. **Compliance**: Some organizations have data residency requirements that mandate data to be stored and processed within specific regions.
3. **Availability**: Certain Azure services and features might only be available in specific regions. Selecting the appropriate location ensures compatibility and access to these features.
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Placing your Event Grid topics in different regions can help with disaster recovery and high availability strategies.

When you create an Event Grid topic, you specify the location property to determine where the topic will reside[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operational-excellence/relocation-event-grid-system-topics).

## Location of Event Grid Topic VS Location of Resource Group
Yes, the location of an Azure Event Grid topic can be different from the location of the resource group it belongs to. When you create an Event Grid topic, you can specify any Azure region for the topic, regardless of the resource group's location[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operational-excellence/relocation-event-grid-system-topics)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58277364/azure-event-grid-subscriptions-on-custom-topic-in-different-resource-group).

## Co-locating Event Grid and Resource Group
Placing the resource group in the same region as your Event Grid topic can indeed have benefits, such as:

1. **Reduced Latency**: Keeping resources in the same region minimizes latency, ensuring faster communication and event processing.
2. **Simplified Management**: Managing resources within the same region can simplify administrative tasks and reduce complexity.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Data transfer costs between resources in the same region are typically lower compared to cross-region transfers.

## Separating locations of Event Grid Topic and Resource Group
However, there are scenarios where you might want to keep them in different regions:

1. **Disaster Recovery**: Spreading resources across different regions can enhance resilience and disaster recovery capabilities.
2. **Compliance**: Certain data residency requirements might necessitate keeping specific resources in particular regions.
3. **Resource Availability**: Some Azure services or features might only be available in specific regions, influencing where you place your resources.

### Summary
* Ultimately, the decision depends on your specific requirements and priorities.
* **If latency and simplified management are critical**, aligning the resource group and Event Grid topic in the same region is beneficial.
* **For disaster recovery and compliance, a multi-region approach might be more suitable**[1](https://www.technetmagazine.com/master-solutions-azure-event-grid/)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/create-custom-topic).
