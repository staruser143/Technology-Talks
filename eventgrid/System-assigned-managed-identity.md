A **system-assigned managed identity** for an Azure Event Grid topic provides a secure and streamlined way to authenticate and authorize event delivery to various Azure services without needing to manage credentials manually. Here are some key usages:

1. **Secure Event Delivery**:
   - **Scenario**: When you need to deliver events to services like Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage.
   - **Solution**: The system-assigned managed identity can be granted the necessary permissions (e.g., Service Bus Data Sender role) to securely send events to these services[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/enable-identity-system-topics).

2. **Simplified Authentication**:
   - **Scenario**: Avoiding the hassle of managing secrets or keys for authentication.
   - **Solution**: The managed identity automatically handles authentication with Azure Active Directory (AAD), simplifying the process and enhancing security[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - **Scenario**: Implementing fine-grained access control for event delivery.
   - **Solution**: You can assign specific roles to the managed identity, ensuring it only has the permissions necessary for its tasks[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).

4. **Dead-Lettering**:
   - **Scenario**: Handling events that cannot be delivered to their intended destination.
   - **Solution**: The managed identity can be used to authenticate and store dead-lettered events in a storage account, ensuring they are securely retained for further analysis[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).

### Example Use Case:
- **Event Delivery to Service Bus**: When creating an event subscription, you can enable the system-assigned managed identity to authenticate and send events to a Service Bus queue. This setup ensures secure and efficient event delivery without manual credential management[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).


If you don't enable a system-assigned managed identity for your Azure Event Grid topic, you'll need to manage authentication and authorization manually. Here are some potential consequences:

1. **Manual Credential Management**:
   - **Scenario**: You'll need to use shared access signatures (SAS), keys, or other credentials to authenticate event delivery.
   - **Consequence**: This approach can be less secure and more cumbersome, as you'll need to rotate and manage these credentials regularly[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/enable-identity-system-topics).

2. **Increased Complexity**:
   - **Scenario**: Setting up and maintaining secure connections to event handlers like Azure Service Bus, Event Hubs, or Storage Accounts.
   - **Consequence**: Without managed identities, you'll have to configure and maintain these connections manually, increasing the complexity of your setup[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).

3. **Potential Security Risks**:
   - **Scenario**: Storing and handling credentials in your application code or configuration files.
   - **Consequence**: This can expose your application to security risks, such as credential leakage or unauthorized access[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).

4. **Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - **Scenario**: Implementing fine-grained access control for event delivery.
   - **Consequence**: Without managed identities, you might not be able to leverage Azure's RBAC features effectively, leading to less granular control over permissions[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).
