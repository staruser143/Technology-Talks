# What is System-Assigned Managed Identity ?
A **system-assigned managed identity** for an Azure Event Grid topic provides a secure and streamlined way to authenticate and authorize event delivery to various Azure services without needing to manage credentials manually. Here are some key usages:

|       | Scenario   |Solution    |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **Secure Event Delivery** | When we need to deliver events to services like Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage. | The system-assigned managed identity can be granted the necessary permissions (e.g., Service Bus Data Sender role) to securely send events to these services[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/enable-identity-system-topics).   |
| **Simplified Authentication** | Avoiding the hassle of managing secrets or keys for authentication.  | The managed identity automatically handles authentication with Azure Active Directory (AAD), simplifying the process and enhancing security[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).   |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Implementing fine-grained access control for event delivery.    | We can assign specific roles to the managed identity, ensuring it only has the permissions necessary for its tasks[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).   |
| **Dead-Lettering** |Handling events that cannot be delivered to their intended destination.   | The managed identity can be used to authenticate and store dead-lettered events in a storage account, ensuring they are securely retained for further analysis[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).  |


### Example Use Case:
**Event Delivery to Service Bus**:
-  When creating an event subscription, we can enable the system-assigned managed identity to authenticate and send events to a Service Bus queue.
-  This setup ensures secure and efficient event delivery without manual credential management[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).

## Consequences of Disabling System-assigned Managed Identity
* If we don't enable a system-assigned managed identity for the Azure Event Grid topic, we'll need to manage authentication and authorization manually.

Here are some potential consequences:

|       | Scenario  | Consequence  |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **Manual Credential Management** | We'll need to use shared access signatures (SAS), keys, or other credentials to authenticate event delivery.   | This approach can be less secure and more cumbersome, as we'll need to rotate and manage these credentials regularly[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/enable-identity-system-topics).  |
| **Increased Complexity** | Setting up and maintaining secure connections to event handlers like Azure Service Bus, Event Hubs, or Storage Accounts.   |   : Without managed identities, we'll have to configure and maintain these connections manually, increasing the complexity of the setup[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity). |
| **Potential Security Risks** | Storing and handling credentials in the application code or configuration files.   |  This can expose the application to security risks, such as credential leakage or unauthorized access[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity).   |
| ***Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Implementing fine-grained access control for event delivery.   |  Without managed identities, we might not be able to leverage Azure's RBAC features effectively, leading to less granular control over permissions[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/managed-service-identity). |
