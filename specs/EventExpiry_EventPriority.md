In the insurance domain, the **`eventExpiry`** and **`eventPriority`** fields can play crucial roles in managing the lifecycle and processing order of events, especially in scenarios like **Quotes** and **Enrollments**. Letâ€™s explore how these fields can be used effectively in this context.

---

### **Scenario: Insurance Quotes and Enrollments**

1. **Quotes**:
   - A customer requests a quote for an insurance policy.
   - The quote is valid for a limited time (e.g., 30 days).
   - The system needs to prioritize the processing of quotes to ensure timely responses to customers.

2. **Enrollments**:
   - A customer decides to enroll in an insurance policy based on a quote.
   - The enrollment process involves multiple steps (e.g., payment processing, policy generation).
   - The system needs to ensure that enrollments are processed in a timely manner, especially for high-priority customers (e.g., corporate clients).

### **Purpose of `eventExpiry` and `eventPriority`**

#### **1. `eventExpiry`**
- **Purpose**: Indicates the time after which the event is no longer valid or relevant.
- **Use Case**:
  - For **quotes**, the `eventExpiry` field ensures that quotes are processed before they expire.
  - For **enrollments**, the `eventExpiry` field ensures that enrollment steps (e.g., payment) are completed within a specific timeframe.

#### **2. `eventPriority`**
- **Purpose**: Indicates the priority level of the event (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Use Case**:
  - For **quotes**, the `eventPriority` field ensures that high-priority quotes (e.g., from corporate clients) are processed first.
  - For **enrollments**, the `eventPriority` field ensures that high-priority enrollments (e.g., from VIP customers) are processed faster.

---

### **Step-by-Step Flow with `eventExpiry` and `eventPriority`**

#### **1. Event: QuoteRequested**
- A customer requests a quote for an insurance policy.
- The `QuoteService` emits a `QuoteRequested` event with:
  - **`eventExpiry`**: 30 days from the request date.
  - **`eventPriority`**: `High` (for corporate clients) or `Medium` (for individual customers).

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-001",
  "eventType": "QuoteRequested",
  "eventTraceID": "trace-123",
  "eventSpanID": "span-1",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:34:56Z",
  "source": "QuoteService",
  "eventExpiry": "2023-10-31T12:34:56Z", // 30 days from request
  "eventPriority": "High", // Corporate client
  "payload": {
    "quoteId": "quote-123",
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "policyType": "Health",
    "coverageAmount": 500000
  }
}
```

#### **2. Event: QuoteGenerated**
- The `QuoteService` processes the `QuoteRequested` event and generates a quote.
- It emits a `QuoteGenerated` event with:
  - **`eventExpiry`**: Same as the `QuoteRequested` event (30 days).
  - **`eventPriority`**: Inherited from the `QuoteRequested` event.

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-002",
  "eventType": "QuoteGenerated",
  "eventTraceID": "trace-123",
  "eventSpanID": "span-2",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:35:10Z",
  "source": "QuoteService",
  "eventExpiry": "2023-10-31T12:34:56Z", // 30 days from request
  "eventPriority": "High", // Corporate client
  "payload": {
    "quoteId": "quote-123",
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "policyType": "Health",
    "coverageAmount": 500000,
    "premiumAmount": 1000
  }
}
```

#### **3. Event: EnrollmentRequested**
- The customer decides to enroll in the policy based on the quote.
- The `EnrollmentService` emits an `EnrollmentRequested` event with:
  - **`eventExpiry`**: 7 days from the enrollment request (to complete the enrollment process).
  - **`eventPriority`**: `High` (for corporate clients) or `Medium` (for individual customers).

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-003",
  "eventType": "EnrollmentRequested",
  "eventTraceID": "trace-123",
  "eventSpanID": "span-3",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-02T10:00:00Z",
  "source": "EnrollmentService",
  "eventExpiry": "2023-10-09T10:00:00Z", // 7 days to complete enrollment
  "eventPriority": "High", // Corporate client
  "payload": {
    "enrollmentId": "enroll-789",
    "quoteId": "quote-123",
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "policyType": "Health",
    "premiumAmount": 1000
  }
}
```

#### **4. Event: PaymentProcessed**
- The `PaymentService` processes the payment for the enrollment.
- It emits a `PaymentProcessed` event with:
  - **`eventExpiry`**: Inherited from the `EnrollmentRequested` event (7 days).
  - **`eventPriority`**: Inherited from the `EnrollmentRequested` event.

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-004",
  "eventType": "PaymentProcessed",
  "eventTraceID": "trace-123",
  "eventSpanID": "span-4",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-02T10:30:00Z",
  "source": "PaymentService",
  "eventExpiry": "2023-10-09T10:00:00Z", // 7 days to complete enrollment
  "eventPriority": "High", // Corporate client
  "payload": {
    "enrollmentId": "enroll-789",
    "paymentId": "payment-123",
    "status": "Success"
  }
}
```

#### **5. Event: PolicyGenerated**
- The `PolicyService` generates the insurance policy after the payment is processed.
- It emits a `PolicyGenerated` event with:
  - **`eventExpiry`**: Inherited from the `EnrollmentRequested` event (7 days).
  - **`eventPriority`**: Inherited from the `EnrollmentRequested` event.

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-005",
  "eventType": "PolicyGenerated",
  "eventTraceID": "trace-123",
  "eventSpanID": "span-5",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-02T11:00:00Z",
  "source": "PolicyService",
  "eventExpiry": "2023-10-09T10:00:00Z", // 7 days to complete enrollment
  "eventPriority": "High", // Corporate client
  "payload": {
    "policyId": "policy-456",
    "enrollmentId": "enroll-789",
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "policyType": "Health",
    "coverageAmount": 500000,
    "premiumAmount": 1000
  }
}
```

### **How `eventExpiry` and `eventPriority` Are Used**

#### **1. `eventExpiry`**
- **Quotes**:
  - The system ensures that quotes are processed before they expire (e.g., within 30 days).
  - Expired quotes are automatically discarded or flagged for review.
- **Enrollments**:
  - The system ensures that enrollment steps (e.g., payment, policy generation) are completed within the specified timeframe (e.g., 7 days).
  - Expired enrollments are flagged for manual intervention.

#### **2. `eventPriority`**
- **Quotes**:
  - High-priority quotes (e.g., from corporate clients) are processed before medium-priority quotes (e.g., from individual customers).
- **Enrollments**:
  - High-priority enrollments (e.g., from VIP customers) are processed faster than medium-priority enrollments.

### **Example Workflow**

| **Step**            | **Event Type**        | **eventExpiry**         | **eventPriority** | **Outcome**                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1. Quote Requested   | `QuoteRequested`      | 30 days from request     | High              | Quote is prioritized for processing.     |
| 2. Quote Generated   | `QuoteGenerated`      | 30 days from request     | High              | Quote is sent to the customer.           |
| 3. Enrollment Requested | `EnrollmentRequested` | 7 days to complete       | High              | Enrollment is prioritized for processing.|
| 4. Payment Processed | `PaymentProcessed`    | 7 days to complete       | High              | Payment is processed quickly.            |
| 5. Policy Generated  | `PolicyGenerated`     | 7 days to complete       | High              | Policy is generated and sent to the customer. |

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **`eventExpiry`**:
   - Ensures that events are processed within a specific timeframe.
   - Helps in managing the lifecycle of quotes and enrollments.

2. **`eventPriority`**:
   - Ensures that high-priority events are processed faster.
   - Helps in providing better service to high-value customers (e.g., corporate clients).

3. **Combined Use**:
   - Together, these fields ensure that the system processes events efficiently and meets business requirements (e.g., timely quotes, fast enrollments).

By using `eventExpiry` and `eventPriority`, you can build a robust and efficient event-driven system for managing insurance quotes and enrollments.
