# Schema Design for WRITE Model

Designing a schema for the WRITE model in a CQRS-based system with MongoDB involves several best practices to ensure efficiency and scalability. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Understand the Data Access Patterns**: Design the schema based on how the application will access the data. This includes understanding the read and write patterns, as well as the relationships between different data entities.

2. **Use Embedded Documents**: For related data that is frequently accessed together, consider using embedded documents. This can reduce the need for joins and improve performance.

3. **Denormalize Data**: Unlike relational databases, MongoDB benefits from denormalization. This means duplicating data where necessary to optimize read performance.

4. **Schema Versioning**: Implement schema versioning to handle changes over time. This allows us to evolve the schema without disrupting existing data.

5. **Indexing**: Use indexes to improve query performance. Be mindful of the types of indexes we create, as they can impact write performance.

6. **Partitioning**: For large datasets, consider partitioning the data to distribute the load and improve performance.

7. **Avoid Over-Normalization**: While normalization is a common practice in relational databases, over-normalizing in MongoDB can lead to performance issues.
8.  Aim for a balance that suits our application's needs.

9. **Use Schema Validation**: Leverage MongoDB's schema validation to enforce data integrity and ensure that the documents adhere to the defined schema.

10. **Optimize for Write Operations**: Since this is the WRITE model, prioritize schema designs that optimize write operations. This might involve trade-offs with read performance, but it's essential for maintaining high write throughput.

11. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the database performance and be prepared to adjust the schema as the application evolves.

By following these best practices, we can design a robust and efficient schema for the WRITE model in the CQRS-based system using MongoDB.

Designing the WRITE model for a Quoting domain in a CQRS-based system requires careful consideration to ensure it handles multiple commands efficiently. Hereâ€™s a potential structure for the schema in MongoDB, which can accommodate various commands like `savePersonalInfo`, `saveContactDetails`, `saveDependentInfo`, `saveEmploymentInfo`, `saveQuote`, `updateQuote`, `addDependentToQuote`, and `addProductToQuote`.

### MongoDB Schema Design for Quote 

**Quote Document Structure:**

```json
{
  "quoteId": "string",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "dob": "string",
    "gender": "string"
  },
  "contactDetails": {
    "email": "string",
    "phone": "string",
    "address": {
      "street": "string",
      "city": "string",
      "state": "string",
      "postalCode": "string",
      "country": "string"
    }
  },
  "employmentInfo": {
    "employer": "string",
    "position": "string",
    "salary": "number",
    "employmentStatus": "string"
  },
  "dependents": [
    {
      "dependentId": "string",
      "firstName": "string",
      "lastName": "string",
      "dob": "string",
      "relationship": "string"
    }
  ],
  "products": [
    {
      "productId": "string",
      "productName": "string",
      "productType": "string",
      "premium": "number",
      "coverageAmount": "number"
    }
  ],
  "status": "string",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Validation**: Use schema validation to ensure data integrity. Validate each command before processing.
- **Indexing**: Index fields that are frequently queried, such as `quoteId`, to improve query performance.
- **Partitioning**: For large datasets, consider partitioning the Quotes collection by a logical shard key, such as `quoteId`.

By following these guidelines, we can create a well-structured WRITE model that efficiently handles multiple commands in the Quoting domain.


# Including Version and Status Field
Incorporating both a version field and a status field in your Quote schema enables accommodating schema evolution and track the status of each quote. 


### Enhanced MongoDB Schema Design

**Quote Document Structure:**

```json
{
  "quoteId": "string",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string",
    "dob": "string",
    "gender": "string"
  },
  "contactDetails": {
    "email": "string",
    "phone": "string",
    "address": {
      "street": "string",
      "city": "string",
      "state": "string",
      "postalCode": "string",
      "country": "string"
    }
  },
  "employmentInfo": {
    "employer": "string",
    "position": "string",
    "salary": "number",
    "employmentStatus": "string"
  },
  "dependents": [
    {
      "dependentId": "string",
      "firstName": "string",
      "lastName": "string",
      "dob": "string",
      "relationship": "string"
    }
  ],
  "products": [
    {
      "productId": "string",
      "productName": "string",
      "productType": "string",
      "premium": "number",
      "coverageAmount": "number"
    }
  ],
  "marketCategory": "string", // e.g., Individual or Medicare
  "location": {
    "state": "string",
    "zipCode": "string"
  },
  "status": "string", // e.g., Saved, Updated, Approved, Declined
  "version": "number",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
```

### Best Practices for Versioning and Status

1. **Version Field**: 
   - Include a `version` field to manage schema evolution. Each time a document is updated, increment the version number. This helps in tracking changes and handling concurrency.
   - Use optimistic concurrency control to handle updates, ensuring that changes are based on the correct document version.

2. **Status Field**:
   - Include a `status` field to track the lifecycle of the quote. Define a set of statuses such as `Saved`, `Updated`, `Approved`, `Declined`, etc.
   - Implement state transitions to enforce valid status changes, ensuring the quote follows the correct workflow.

3. **Handling Market Category and Location**:
   - Include fields for `marketCategory`, `state`, and `zipCode` to capture dependencies on market category and location.
   - Use these fields to apply business rules and validation specific to each category or location.

This enhanced schema design ensures that the system can manage schema evolution, and track the status of each quote. 

# Including _Id and Domain Specific ID field

In MongoDB, each document automatically has a unique `_id` field, which serves as the primary key.
We have a couple of options when it comes to storing the domain/aggregate ID:

### Option 1: Use `_id` for Domain/Aggregate ID
We can use the default `_id` field to store the domain-specific or aggregate ID. 
This approach simplifies your schema by leveraging the existing unique identifier provided by MongoDB.

**Pros**:
- No need for an additional field.
- Ensures uniqueness by default.
- Simplifies indexing and querying.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "_id": "domainSpecificId",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  // Other fields...
}
```

### Option 2: Use a Separate Field for Domain/Aggregate ID
We can add a separate field for the domain-specific or aggregate ID while keeping the `_id` field. 
This approach provides more flexibility, especially if we need to distinguish between internal MongoDB IDs and domain-specific IDs.

**Pros**:
- Clear separation between MongoDB's internal ID and your domain ID.
- Flexibility in managing different types of IDs.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "_id": "mongodbGeneratedId",
  "quoteId": "domainSpecificId",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  // Other fields...
}
```

### Considerations
- **Uniqueness**: Ensure that the domain-specific ID field (`quoteId` in the example) is unique. We can create a unique index on this field to enforce uniqueness.
- **Query Performance**: If we frequently query by the domain-specific ID, consider creating an index on that field to improve query performance.
- **Clarity**: Using a separate field can make the schema more explicit and clear, especially for developers who need to understand the distinction between internal and domain-specific IDs.

### Example Index Creation
If we choose to use a separate field, we can create a unique index on the domain-specific ID field:

```javascript
db.collection('quotes').createIndex({ quoteId: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

### Recommendation
If the primary concern is simplicity and we don't have a strong need to differentiate between MongoDB's internal ID and your domain ID, using `_id` for the domain-specific ID is a straightforward approach. However, if we anticipate the need for clear separation or additional flexibility, using a separate field is a viable option.


# Schema Evolution

Evolving a schema while maintaining compatibility for both old and new clients can be a challenge. 
Here are some strategies to handle schema evolution and ensure smooth transitions:

### Schema Evolution Strategies

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Design the new schema changes to be backward compatible. This means that existing clients can continue to operate with the old schema while new clients use the updated schema.
   - Use default values for new fields so that old clients can ignore them.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "quoteId": "domainSpecificId",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "newField": "defaultValue", // New field with a default value
  "version": 1
}
```

2. **Versioning in Data**:
   - Include a `schemaVersion` field in your documents. This helps in identifying which version of the schema the document adheres to.
   - Write code that handles different schema versions appropriately.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "quoteId": "domainSpecificId",
  "personalInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "newField": "defaultValue",
  "version": 1,
  "schemaVersion": 2 // Indicates the schema version
}
```

3. **Transformations and Migrations**:
   - Implement transformations or migrations to convert data from the old schema to the new schema. This can be done in real-time as data is accessed or through a batch process.
   - Store data in a format that can be easily transformed or migrated to the new schema.

**Example**:
- **Real-time Transformation**: When an old client accesses the data, transform it to the old schema format on-the-fly.
- **Batch Migration**: Run a background process to migrate all existing documents to the new schema.

4. **Feature Flags**:
   - Use feature flags to control the rollout of new schema features. This allows you to gradually introduce new features to a subset of clients before enabling them for everyone.
   - Monitor the usage and performance of the new schema under controlled conditions.

5. **API Versioning**:
   - Version your APIs to handle different schema versions. Old clients can continue to use the old API version, while new clients can use the updated API version.
   - This allows you to maintain separate code paths for different schema versions.

**Example**:
- `/api/v1/quotes` for the old schema.
- `/api/v2/quotes` for the new schema.

### Handling Schema Evolution in Practice

1. **Read and Write Handlers**:
   - Implement separate read and write handlers for different schema versions. These handlers can convert data to the appropriate schema format based on the `schemaVersion` field.

2. **Schema Validation**:
   - Use MongoDB's schema validation to enforce data integrity for different schema versions. This ensures that documents adhere to the correct schema based on their version.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed documentation of schema changes and versioning strategies. This helps developers understand how to handle different schema versions and ensures consistency across the system.

By adopting these strategies,we can evolve your schema smoothly, accommodate both old and new clients, and maintain data integrity.
