Using stored procedures for some aspects of this process can make sense, but it's not a silver bullet and comes with trade-offs.  Let's break down where stored procedures might be helpful and where they might not be the best fit:
Where Stored Procedures Can Be Useful:
 * Atomic Operations (Event Store Append):  Stored procedures can be very effective for ensuring atomicity when appending events to the event store.  The check for an existing event and the insertion of the new event (with version increment) can be encapsulated within a single stored procedure.  This eliminates the possibility of a race condition where two processes might try to add the same event concurrently.  Cosmos DB supports transactions within stored procedures, which is essential for atomicity.
 * Conditional Updates (Domain Store Upsert):  Similar to the event store, you can use a stored procedure to perform the conditional upsert (with version check) in your domain data store.  This can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips to the database.  The stored procedure can read the current version, perform the update conditionally, and increment the version, all within a single database operation.
 * Complex Data Transformations: If your domain updates involve complex data transformations or calculations, a stored procedure might be a good place to put that logic.  This can keep your application code cleaner and potentially improve performance.
Where Stored Procedures Might Not Be the Best Fit:
 * Idempotency Checks (Change Feed Processing):  While you could technically use a stored procedure to check if an event has been processed, it's generally not recommended.  The overhead of calling a stored procedure for every event would likely outweigh the benefits.  It's much more efficient to maintain a separate "processed events" collection and query it directly from your change feed processor.
 * Application Logic: Stored procedures are best suited for database-centric operations.  Complex application logic, especially logic that involves external dependencies or business rules, is usually better handled in your application code.  Trying to implement too much application logic in stored procedures can make your code harder to maintain and debug.
 * Testing and Debugging: Stored procedures can be more difficult to test and debug than application code.  You might need specialized tools and techniques for debugging stored procedures.
 * Version Control:  Managing versions of stored procedures can be more complex than managing versions of application code.
Key Considerations:
 * Performance: Stored procedures can improve performance for certain database-intensive operations.  However, they can also introduce overhead if used inappropriately.  It's important to benchmark your code to see if stored procedures actually provide a performance benefit in your specific use case.
 * Maintainability:  Stored procedures can make your code harder to maintain if they become too complex.  It's important to keep your stored procedures focused on specific database operations and avoid putting too much application logic in them.
 * Complexity:  Stored procedures add another layer of complexity to your system.  You need to consider the trade-offs between the benefits of stored procedures and the added complexity.
Recommendation:
 * Event Store Append: Using a stored procedure for atomic event appending is generally a good idea.  It ensures data integrity and prevents race conditions.
 * Domain Store Upsert:  A stored procedure can also be beneficial for the conditional upsert in your domain data store, especially if the update logic is complex.
 * Change Feed Idempotency:  For change feed idempotency checks, stick with querying a separate "processed events" collection from your application code.  This is usually the most efficient approach.
 * Other Logic:  For other application logic, especially logic that involves external dependencies or complex business rules, it's usually better to keep that logic in your application code.
In summary, use stored procedures strategically for database-centric operations where they can provide a clear benefit in terms of atomicity, performance, or code organization.  Avoid using them for complex application logic or for operations where a simpler approach (like querying a separate collection) would be more efficient.  Always benchmark your code to make sure that stored procedures are actually providing the expected benefits.
