When writing to Event store like cosmosdb how do I ensure there are no duplicate events added

There are several ways to ensure no duplicate events are added to your Cosmos DB event store:
1. Unique Event IDs:
 * Generate UUIDs: Assign a universally unique identifier (UUID) to each event upon creation. This is the most common and generally recommended approach. UUIDs are long, random strings that virtually guarantee uniqueness across all events.
 * Check for Existing ID: Before inserting an event, query your Cosmos DB collection to see if an event with that UUID already exists. If it does, discard the new event.
2. Event Versioning:
 * Assign Sequential Numbers: Give each event in a stream a sequential version number. For example, the first event in a stream would be version 1, the second version 2, and so on.
 * Conditional Updates: When writing an event, use a conditional update operation in Cosmos DB. This operation checks if the expected version number (the next number in the sequence) is present before inserting the new event. If the version number doesn't match, the update fails, preventing duplicates.
3. Idempotent Event Handling:
 * Design Event Handlers to be Idempotent: Ensure that your event processing logic can handle the same event multiple times without causing unintended side effects. This is important even if you have measures to prevent duplicates, as message delivery systems can sometimes deliver the same message more than once.
 * Track Processed Events: Maintain a record of events that have already been processed. When an event handler receives an event, it first checks if the event has been processed before. If it has, the handler can safely ignore the event.
4. Cosmos DB Features:
 * Unique Index: Create a unique index on the event ID field in your Cosmos DB collection. This will prevent the insertion of documents with duplicate IDs at the database level.
 * Stored Procedures: You can use stored procedures in Cosmos DB to encapsulate the logic for checking for duplicate events and inserting new events. This can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips to the database.
5. Optimistic Locking:
 * Use a Version Field: Add a version field to your event documents. When updating an event, include the current version number in the update request. If the version number in the database matches the version number in the request, the update is performed, and the version number is incremented. If the version numbers don't match, the update fails, indicating that another process has modified the event in the meantime.
Important Considerations:
 * Choose the Right Approach: The best approach for preventing duplicate events depends on your specific requirements and the complexity of your event sourcing system.
 * Performance: Consider the performance implications of each approach. Checking for existing events before inserting can add latency, especially if your event store is large.
 * Consistency: Ensure that your event writing process is atomic. This means that either the event is successfully written to the event store, or it is not. Partial writes can lead to inconsistencies and potential duplicates.
By implementing one or more of these techniques, you can effectively prevent duplicate events from being added to your Cosmos DB event store, ensuring the integrity and reliability of your event-sourced application.


Can you provide more details on using sequential numbers and also what would be a stream be?


Let's delve deeper into using sequential numbers for duplicate prevention and clarify what a "stream" represents in event sourcing.
Sequential Numbers (Versioning) for Duplicate Prevention
This method relies on assigning a sequential version number to each event within a specific stream.  A stream is a sequence of events related to a particular entity or aggregate in your domain.  Think of it as the history of changes for a single "thing" in your system.
 * Stream Definition: A stream is a logical grouping of events.  It's typically associated with a specific entity or aggregate.  For example, in an e-commerce system, you might have a stream for each customer, each order, or each product.  The stream ID is what ties all the events together.  It might be the CustomerID, OrderID, or ProductID.
 * Versioning:  Each event within a stream gets a sequential version number. The first event in a stream has version 1, the second version 2, and so on.
 * Writing an Event: When you want to add a new event to a stream:
   * Retrieve Current Version: Before writing, you need to know the current highest version number for that stream. You'd query your Cosmos DB for the highest version number associated with the specific stream ID.
   * Increment and Write: Increment the retrieved version number.  This is your new event's version.  Then, write the new event to Cosmos DB conditionally.  The condition is crucial: you only want the write to succeed if the current highest version in the database still matches the version you retrieved.
 * Cosmos DB Conditional Updates: Cosmos DB supports conditional updates using optimistic locking.  You include the expected version number in your write request.  Cosmos DB checks this version against the version stored with the document.  If they match, the update (insert, in this case) succeeds, and the version in the database is updated.  If they don't match, the update fails.  This failure indicates that another process has already added an event to the stream in the meantime.
 * Handling Conflicts: If the conditional update fails, it means a concurrent write occurred.  You'll need to handle this conflict.  Typically, you would:
   * Retry: Retrieve the latest version number from the database and retry the write operation with the updated version.
   * Investigate: In some cases, frequent conflicts might indicate a problem with your application logic, and you might want to investigate why so many concurrent writes are happening.
Example (Conceptual):
Let's say you have a stream for CustomerID: 123.
 * Current highest version for CustomerID: 123 is 5.
 * You want to add a new event. You increment the version to 6.
 * You send a write request to Cosmos DB: "Insert this event for CustomerID: 123 with version 6, only if the current highest version is still 5."
 *    * Scenario 1 (Success): If the version is still 5 in Cosmos DB, the write succeeds.  The version in the database is now updated to 6.
   * Scenario 2 (Conflict): If another process has already added an event, and the version in Cosmos DB is now 6 (or higher), the conditional write fails. You get an error. You then retrieve the current version (likely 6), increment it to 7, and retry.
Benefits of Sequential Numbers:
 * Guarantees No Duplicates:  The conditional update ensures that each event is written only once, even with concurrent writes.
 * Ordering:  Events are implicitly ordered by their version number within a stream.
Drawbacks:
 * Requires Careful Implementation: You need to manage version numbers correctly and handle conflicts.
 * Potential for Conflicts:  High concurrency can lead to frequent conflicts and retries, which might impact performance.
What is a Stream?
A stream is a fundamental concept in event sourcing. It represents the chronological sequence of events related to a single entity or aggregate.  It's the history of changes for a specific "thing" in your domain.
 * Example 1: Customer Stream: A customer stream contains all the events related to a particular customer: CustomerCreated, AddressChanged, OrderPlaced, EmailUpdated, etc.
 * Example 2: Product Stream: A product stream contains events like ProductCreated, PriceChanged, InventoryUpdated, etc.
Streams are identified by a unique ID (e.g., CustomerID, ProductID).  All events within a stream share the same ID.  This ID is what you use to retrieve the events for a specific entity.
In summary, sequential numbers combined with conditional updates in Cosmos DB provide a robust mechanism for ensuring that you never have duplicate events in your event store, while also preserving the order of events within each stream.  Understanding the concept of a "stream" is essential for effectively using event sourcing.


Can you provide examples of implementing this in NestJS to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API


import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CosmosClient, Database, Container } from '@azure/cosmos';

@Injectable()
export class EventStoreService {
  private database: Database;
  private container: Container;

  constructor() {
    const endpoint = process.env.COSMOS_ENDPOINT; // Your Cosmos DB endpoint
    const key = process.env.COSMOS_KEY; // Your Cosmos DB key
    const client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, key });

    this.database = client.database('your-database-name'); // Your database name
    this.container = this.database.container('your-container-name'); // Your container name
  }

  async appendToStream(streamId: string, event: any): Promise<void> {
    const { resource: latestEvent } = await this.container.items
      .query(`SELECT TOP 1 * FROM c WHERE c.streamId = @streamId ORDER BY c.version DESC`, {
        parameters: [{ name: '@streamId', value: streamId }],
      })
      .fetchNext();

    const nextVersion = latestEvent ? latestEvent.version + 1 : 1;

    try {
      await this.container.items.create({
        ...event,
        streamId,
        version: nextVersion,
      }, {
        // Optimistic locking using a filter condition
        filter: latestEvent ? {
          filter: `c.streamId = @streamId AND c.version = @expectedVersion`,
          parameters: [
            { name: '@streamId', value: streamId },
            { name: '@expectedVersion', value: latestEvent.version },
          ],
        } : undefined // No filter needed for the first event
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      if (error.code === 409) { // Conflict (another event was added)
        console.warn(`Conflict appending to stream ${streamId}. Retrying...`);
        return this.appendToStream(streamId, event); // Retry with the latest version
      }
      throw error; // Re-throw other errors
    }
  }

  async getStream(streamId: string): Promise<any[]> {
    const { resources: events } = await this.container.items
      .query(`SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.streamId = @streamId ORDER BY c.version ASC`, {
        parameters: [{ name: '@streamId', value: streamId }],
      })
      .fetchAll();
    return events;
  }
}

Explanation and Key Improvements:
 * Dependency Injection: Uses NestJS's dependency injection to inject the CosmosClient.
 * Cosmos DB Setup: Initializes the CosmosClient, Database, and Container in the constructor.  Make sure you have the necessary @azure/cosmos package installed (npm install @azure/cosmos).
 * appendToStream Function:
   * Retrieves Latest Version: Queries for the latest event in the stream to get the current version.  Uses TOP 1 and ORDER BY DESC for efficiency.
   * Calculates Next Version: Increments the latest version or starts at 1 if it's the first event.
   * Conditional Create (Optimistic Locking):  The crucial part!  The filter option in container.items.create implements the optimistic locking.
     * If latestEvent exists (not the first event), it creates a filter that ensures the write only succeeds if the current version in the database matches the version we retrieved.
     * If latestEvent is undefined (first event), no filter is provided, allowing the first event to be inserted without a version check. This handles the initial event of a stream.
   * Conflict Handling (Retry): Catches the 409 error (conflict) which Cosmos DB returns when the conditional update fails.  It logs a warning and retries the operation. This is important for handling concurrent writes.  You might want to implement a maximum retry count to prevent infinite loops.
   * Error Handling: Re-throws any other errors that are not conflicts.
 * getStream Function: Retrieves all events for a given streamId and orders them by version.
 * Environment Variables: Uses environment variables (process.env) for the Cosmos DB endpoint and key, which is best practice for security.
How to Use:
 * Import: Import the EventStoreService into your NestJS module.
 * Inject: Inject the EventStoreService into your service or controller where you need to use it.
 * Call appendToStream: Call appendToStream to add new events to a stream:
// In your service or controller
constructor(private readonly eventStoreService: EventStoreService) {}

async createOrder(orderData: any) {
  const orderId = 'order-123'; // Example order ID (stream ID)
  await this.eventStoreService.appendToStream(orderId, {
    type: 'OrderCreated',
    data: orderData,
  });
}

async getOrderEvents(orderId: string) {
  const events = await this.eventStoreService.getStream(orderId);
  return events;
}


Important Notes:
 * Error Handling:  The example includes basic error handling, but you'll likely want to add more robust error management in a production application.
 * Retry Logic: The retry logic is simple. Consider adding a maximum retry count and/or exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the database in high-concurrency scenarios.
 * Idempotency: While this code prevents duplicate events from being stored, you still need to ensure idempotent event handlers.  Your event processing logic should be able to handle the same event multiple times without causing unintended side effects (in case a message is delivered more than once by your messaging system).
 * Stream ID: Choose stream IDs that are meaningful in your domain (e.g., CustomerID, OrderID).
 * Event Data: The event data can be any JSON-serializable object.
This improved example provides a more complete and robust implementation of event appending with duplicate prevention using optimistic locking in Cosmos DB within a NestJS application.  Remember to configure your Cosmos DB connection and adjust the code to fit your specific event structure and domain logic.




Do we need timestamp field also to be included in addition to streamID and version.


Whether or not you need a timestamp field in addition to streamId and version depends on your specific requirements, but it's generally a good practice to include it.  Here's why:
Arguments for Including a Timestamp:
 * Event Ordering (Beyond Version): While the version field guarantees ordering within a stream, a timestamp allows you to see the relative ordering of events across different streams.  This can be invaluable for debugging, auditing, and understanding the overall timeline of your system.  For example, you might want to know if a customer's address was changed before or after an order was placed, even though those events belong to different streams.
 * Time-Based Queries: Timestamps enable you to query your event store for events within a specific time range.  This is useful for reporting, analytics, and reconstructing the state of your system at a particular point in time.  "Give me all the events that occurred between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM today."
 * Debugging and Auditing: Timestamps are essential for debugging and auditing. They provide a clear record of when each event occurred, which can help you trace the cause of errors or investigate suspicious activity.
 * Event Replay: If you need to replay events (e.g., to rebuild a read model), a timestamp can be helpful for ensuring that events are replayed in the correct order, especially if you have complex dependencies between streams.
 * Correlation:  Timestamps can help correlate events from different systems or services. If you're integrating with other systems, timestamps can provide a common point of reference for understanding the sequence of events across system boundaries.
Arguments Against (Less Common):
 * Slightly Increased Storage:  Adding a timestamp will increase the size of your event documents slightly.  However, this is usually negligible unless you have extremely high event volumes.
 * Potential for Clock Drift (If Not Carefully Managed): If your system's clocks are not properly synchronized, timestamps can be inaccurate.  However, this is a general problem with timestamps, not specific to event sourcing.  Use NTP or other clock synchronization mechanisms to mitigate this risk.
Best Practices:
 * Use UTC: Store timestamps in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to avoid timezone issues.
 * Consistent Format: Use a consistent format for your timestamps (e.g., ISO 8601).
 * Server-Side Generation: Generate the timestamp on the server before appending the event to the stream.  This ensures that the timestamp is accurate and consistent. Don't rely on client-provided timestamps.
In summary: While not strictly required for duplicate prevention (that's handled by streamId and version), including a timestamp is almost always a good idea.  The benefits it provides for ordering, querying, debugging, and auditing far outweigh the small cost of increased storage.  It's a standard practice in event sourcing and highly recommended.



When reading from Event store using  Cosmos DB change feed to update domain data store, how can we ensure events are processed correctly


Using Cosmos DB's change feed to update your domain data store is a great way to keep your read models or other downstream systems in sync with your event store. Here's how you can ensure events are processed correctly:
1. Idempotent Event Handlers:
 * Crucial Principle: Design your event handlers to be idempotent. This means that processing the same event multiple times should have the same effect as processing it once.  This is the most important factor in ensuring correct processing, especially when dealing with change feeds, which can sometimes deliver the same event more than once (e.g., due to transient network issues).
 * Track Processed Events:  Maintain a record of which events have already been processed.  This can be a separate collection in Cosmos DB or another data store.  When an event handler receives an event, it first checks if the event ID (or a combination of streamId and version) is in the processed events record.  If it is, the handler can safely ignore the event.
 * Update Processed Events Record Atomically: When an event is successfully processed, update the processed events record atomically with the event ID.  This prevents race conditions where the same event might be processed multiple times concurrently.  Cosmos DB supports atomic operations, so you can use these to ensure that the event processing and the update of the processed events record happen in a single transaction.
2. Handling Change Feed Lease:
 * Lease Collection: The change feed uses a lease collection to track its progress.  Each partition of your Cosmos DB container has a lease document that stores the continuation token (a pointer to the last processed event).
 * Lease Management:  Proper lease management is essential for ensuring that events are processed in order and that no events are missed.  The change feed processor library handles lease management automatically in most cases, but it's important to understand how it works.
 * Checkpointing: The change feed processor periodically checkpoints its progress by updating the lease document. This ensures that if the processor restarts, it can resume from where it left off.
 * Lease Conflicts: If multiple instances of your change feed processor are running, they might try to acquire the same lease. The change feed processor library handles lease conflicts automatically, ensuring that only one processor can own a lease for a given partition at a time.
3. Ordering and Sequencing:
 * Within a Stream: Events within a stream are ordered by their version number.  The change feed will deliver events in the order they were written to the stream.
 * Across Streams: The change feed does not guarantee ordering across different streams.  If you need to ensure that events from different streams are processed in a specific order, you'll need to implement additional logic in your event handlers.  For example, you might use a message queue to coordinate the processing of related events from different streams.
 * Event Versioning: Use the version field in your events to ensure that events are processed in the correct order.  Your event handlers should check the version number of the event before processing it to prevent out-of-order processing.
4. Error Handling and Retries:
 * Transient Errors: Implement proper error handling for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database unavailability).  Use retries with exponential backoff to handle these errors.
 * Poison Events:  Handle "poison events" (events that consistently fail to process) carefully.  You might want to move these events to a dead-letter queue for manual inspection.
 * Dead-letter Queue: A dead-letter queue is a separate storage location for events that could not be processed successfully.  This allows you to investigate and fix the issues that caused the failures and then reprocess the events.
5. Monitoring and Logging:
 * Monitor Change Feed Progress: Monitor the progress of the change feed to ensure that events are being processed in a timely manner.  You can use Azure Monitor or other monitoring tools to track the change feed's lag.
 * Log Event Processing: Log the processing of each event, including the event ID, stream ID, version, and timestamp.  This will help you debug any issues that might arise.
Example (Conceptual - Idempotent Handler with Cosmos DB):
// ... Cosmos DB setup ...

async processEvent(event: any): Promise<void> {
  const eventId = `${event.streamId}-${event.version}`; // Or use a UUID if you have one

  // Check if the event has already been processed
  const { resource: processedEvent } = await this.container.items.read(eventId, eventId);

  if (processedEvent) {
    console.log(`Event ${eventId} already processed. Skipping.`);
    return;
  }

  try {
    // 1. Process the event (update your domain data store)
    await this.updateDomainDataStore(event);

    // 2. Mark the event as processed (atomic operation)
    await this.container.items.create({ id: eventId }, {
        // Options to ensure atomicity
        accessCondition: { type: "Precondition", condition: "not exists c" }
      });

    console.log(`Event ${eventId} processed successfully.`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error processing event ${eventId}:`, error);
    // Implement retry logic, dead-letter queue, etc.
    throw error;
  }
}


By combining these techniques – idempotent handlers, proper lease management, careful ordering considerations, robust error handling, and thorough monitoring – you can build a reliable and scalable system for processing events from your Cosmos DB change feed and updating your domain data store correctly.  Remember that idempotency is the cornerstone of reliable event processing in this context.


Can the field used to guarantee ordering within a stream be called as sequencenumber instead of version. Does this make sense or is it better to stick with version itself


Yes, using sequenceNumber instead of version for the field that guarantees ordering within a stream is perfectly acceptable and can even be more descriptive.  It's a matter of preference and what makes the most sense in your specific domain.
Arguments for sequenceNumber:
 * Clarity:  sequenceNumber clearly communicates the purpose of the field: it represents the sequential order of events within a stream.  It's less ambiguous than version, which might have other connotations in some contexts.
 * Domain Language: If "sequence number" is a term commonly used in your domain to describe the ordering of events or updates, then using it in your code can make your code more readable and easier for domain experts to understand.
Arguments for version:
 * Common Usage: version is a widely used term in event sourcing and version control systems.  Many developers are already familiar with its meaning in this context.
 * Conciseness: version is shorter than sequenceNumber.
Does it make sense?
Yes, using sequenceNumber makes sense.  It's a valid and clear alternative to version.  As long as you are consistent in your codebase and documentation, it's perfectly fine to use it.
Is it better to stick with version?
It's not necessarily better to stick with version.  Both terms are valid.  version might be slightly more common, but sequenceNumber can be more descriptive.
Recommendation:
 * Consistency is Key: The most important thing is to be consistent.  Choose one term (sequenceNumber or version) and use it consistently throughout your codebase and documentation.
 * Consider Your Team: If your team is already familiar with the term version in the context of event sourcing, then sticking with it might be easier.  If you're starting a new project or if you think sequenceNumber would be more descriptive for your team, then go for it.
 * Context Matters: Consider the specific context of your application.  If "sequence number" is a term commonly used in your domain, then it might be a better choice.
In summary, it's a matter of style and clarity.  Both version and sequenceNumber are valid options.  Choose the one that you think is most appropriate for your project and be consistent.


When  upserting the record in domain after the read from change feed, should we do any sort of checks to see if is not already updated or not similar to what was done with Event store.



Yes, you should absolutely perform checks when upserting records in your domain data store after reading from the change feed.  While you've already prevented duplicate events in your event store, the change feed itself can sometimes deliver the same event more than once (due to network issues, restarts, etc.).  Therefore, you need to implement similar idempotent behavior in your domain update logic.
Here's why and how:
Why Checks Are Necessary:
 * Change Feed Redelivery: The change feed is designed for at-least-once delivery.  This means that an event might be delivered multiple times. While rare, it can happen.
 * Idempotency in Domain Updates: Your domain update logic (the code that updates your read models or other domain data) must be idempotent.  Processing the same event multiple times should have the same effect as processing it once.  Without checks, you might end up with incorrect data in your domain store.
 * Concurrency Control: Even with deduplication in the event store, there might be concurrent updates to your domain data from other sources.  You need to handle these concurrent updates gracefully.
How to Implement Checks (Idempotency in Domain Updates):
 * Version or Sequence Number:  The most common and effective approach is to use a version or sequence number in your domain data store, mirroring the versioning you have in your event store.
   * Read Current Version: Before updating a record in your domain store, read the current version number associated with that record.
   * Conditional Update: Use a conditional update operation (like optimistic locking) to update the record only if the version number in the domain store matches the expected version number (the one from the event you're processing).  Increment the version number in the domain store during the update.
 * Event ID Tracking:  If you're not using versions in your domain data, you can track the IDs of the events that have already been applied to your domain data.
   * Processed Events Record: Maintain a separate collection (or table) to store the IDs of processed events.
   * Check Before Update: Before updating the domain data, check if the event ID is already in the processed events record.  If it is, skip the update.
   * Atomic Update of Processed Events:  After successfully updating the domain data, atomically add the event ID to the processed events record.
Example (Conceptual - Versioning in Domain Update):
async updateDomainData(event: any): Promise<void> {
  const recordId = event.streamId; // Assuming streamId is the ID of your domain record

  try {
    // 1. Read Current Version from Domain Store
    const { resource: currentRecord } = await this.domainContainer.items.read(recordId, recordId);
    const currentVersion = currentRecord ? currentRecord.version : 0; // Default to 0 if record doesn't exist

    // 2. Conditional Update (Optimistic Locking)
    await this.domainContainer.items.upsert({
      id: recordId,
      // ... updated domain data from the event ...
      version: event.version, // Use the event's version
    }, {
      // Optimistic locking
      filter: currentRecord ? {
        filter: `c.id = @recordId AND c.version = @expectedVersion`,
        parameters: [
          { name: '@recordId', value: recordId },
          { name: '@expectedVersion', value: currentVersion },
        ],
      } : undefined // No filter needed for the first update
    });

    console.log(`Domain data updated for record ${recordId} (version ${event.version}).`);
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (error.code === 409) { // Conflict (another update occurred)
      console.warn(`Conflict updating domain data for record ${recordId}. Skipping.`);
      return; // Or retry if you need stronger consistency
    }
    console.error(`Error updating domain data for record ${recordId}:`, error);
    throw error; // Or handle the error appropriately
  }
}

Key Improvements in this example:
 * Uses upsert:  Handles both inserts (if the record doesn't exist) and updates efficiently.
 * Optimistic Locking: The filter in the upsert operation implements optimistic locking, ensuring that the update only happens if the version in the domain store matches the expected version.
 * Conflict Handling: Catches the 409 conflict error and logs a warning.  You can choose to retry or simply skip the update in case of a conflict.
 * Handles Initial Update: The filter is only applied if currentRecord exists, so the first update (when the record is being created) doesn't have a version check.
By implementing these checks, you ensure that your domain data is updated correctly, even if the change feed delivers the same event multiple times, and you handle concurrent updates effectively. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency in your application.



I am not sure I understand the need of version or sequence number in domain record when upserting it. Can you provide more details to illustrate the need for them.


You're right to question this! It's important to understand why the version or sequence number is necessary in your domain records when upserting from a change feed.  Let's illustrate with a scenario:
Scenario: E-commerce Order Updates
Imagine you have an e-commerce system, and you're using event sourcing.  You have a Orders domain data store (a read model or materialized view) that you update based on events from your event store.  Let's focus on the OrderShipped event.
Without Versioning in Domain Data:
 * Event Store:  An OrderShipped event (version 3 for order 123) is added to the event store.
 * Change Feed: The change feed picks up the OrderShipped event.
 * Domain Update (No Version Check): Your change feed processor reads the event and updates the Orders domain data, setting the status of order 123 to "Shipped".
 * Redelivery:  Here's the problem: Due to a transient network issue, the change feed redelivers the same OrderShipped event (version 3 for order 123) a short time later.
 * Duplicate Update: Your change feed processor, without any version check, updates the Orders domain data again, setting the status of order 123 to "Shipped" again.  In this simple case, it might seem harmless.  But what if the update involved more complex changes?  What if you were incrementing a "times shipped" counter?  Or updating a last-shipped timestamp?  You'd end up with incorrect data.
With Versioning in Domain Data:
 * Event Store: An OrderShipped event (version 3 for order 123) is added to the event store.
 * Change Feed: The change feed picks up the OrderShipped event.
 * Domain Update (With Version Check):
   * Your change feed processor reads the event (version 3) and also reads the current version of order 123 from the Orders domain data (let's say it's currently version 2, because an earlier event had already been processed).
   * It performs a conditional update: "Update order 123, setting status to 'Shipped' and version to 3, only if the current version in the domain data is still 2."
   * The update succeeds.
 * Redelivery: The change feed redelivers the same OrderShipped event (version 3 for order 123).
 * Idempotent Update:
   * Your change feed processor reads the event (version 3) and tries to update the Orders domain data.
   * It performs the same conditional update: "Update order 123... only if the current version is 2."
   * This time, the conditional update fails because the current version in the domain data is now 3 (it was updated in the previous step).  The update is skipped.  Your domain data remains consistent.
Key Points:
 * Idempotency: The version check in the domain update logic makes the update idempotent.  Processing the same event multiple times has the same effect as processing it once.
 * Preventing Data Corruption:  Without versioning, redelivered events can lead to incorrect data in your domain store, especially if the updates involve more complex logic than just setting a status.
 * Concurrency Handling: Versioning also helps with concurrent updates.  If two different processes try to update the same record at the same time, the optimistic locking mechanism will ensure that only one update succeeds, preventing data corruption.
In essence: The version number in your domain data acts as a guard, ensuring that updates are applied in the correct order and that duplicate updates from redelivered events are ignored.  It's crucial for maintaining data consistency when using change feeds or any other mechanism that might deliver messages multiple times.
