Great question! Let’s clarify the **terminology** and clear up a common confusion.

## ❌ "AcroForms" is **not** an open-source tool — it's a **PDF standard feature**

### 🔹 What is AcroForms?

**AcroForms** (short for **Acrobat Forms**) is a **technology built into the PDF specification** (defined by Adobe and standardized as **ISO 32000**) that allows PDFs to contain **interactive form fields** such as:

- Text fields
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Dropdowns (choice fields)
- Buttons
- Digital signature fields

These forms can be filled out, saved, and submitted using PDF viewers like **Adobe Acrobat Reader**, **Preview (macOS)**, or other compatible software.

> ✅ **AcroForms is part of the PDF format standard**, not a standalone product or library.

It was originally developed by **Adobe**, but it's now part of the **open PDF specification** (ISO 32000), so anyone can implement it — no licensing required.

## ✅ Is It Open?

| Aspect | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Part of PDF spec (ISO 32000) | ✅ Yes, publicly documented and open |
| Can be used freely in software | ✅ Yes (no royalties) |
| Open source tools support it | ✅ Many do (see below) |

👉 So while **"AcroForms" itself isn't a software**, it's an **open, standardized feature of PDFs** that **open-source and commercial tools** can implement.

- Example: `pdftk form.pdf fill_form data.fdf output filled.pdf`

### 5. **LibreOffice Draw / Writer**
- **Open source**: ✅ MPL License
- Can: Create simple PDF forms (text fields, checkboxes).
- Exports to PDF with AcroForms.
- Website: [https://www.libreoffice.org](https://www.libreoffice.org)

### 6. **Inkscape + PDF + Form Export**
- Can be used in combination with LaTeX or manual editing to generate form-capable PDFs (advanced use).

### 7. **QPDF**
- **Open source**: ✅ GPL

## 📌 Summary

| Question | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| **Is AcroForms open source?** | ❌ Not a tool — it's a **standardized feature of PDFs** |
| **Is it open/standardized?** | ✅ Yes — part of **ISO 32000 (PDF spec)** |
| **Can I use it freely?** | ✅ Yes — no licensing required to read/write |
| **Best open-source tools?** | ✅ **PDFBox**, **pdf-lib**, **iText (AGPL)**, **pdftk**, **LibreOffice** |

## ✅ Recommendation

- Need to **automate form filling in Java?** → Use **Apache PDFBox**
- In **Node.js/JavaScript?** → Use **pdf-lib**
- Designing forms visually? → Use **LibreOffice** or **Adobe Acrobat (trial)**, then automate with open tools.
