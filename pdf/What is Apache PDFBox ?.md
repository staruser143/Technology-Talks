### üìå Common Use Cases

1. **Automated Report Generation**
   - Generate invoices, reports, or certificates in PDF format from templates or dynamic data.

2. **Document Archiving and Processing**
   - Extract text from scanned or digital PDFs for indexing in search systems (e.g., Lucene/Solr).
   - Batch process large numbers of PDFs (merge, split, rename).

3. **Form Automation**
   - Auto-fill PDF forms (e.g., tax forms, applications) with user data.
   - Extract data from submitted PDF forms.

4. **Content Redaction or Watermarking**
   - Add watermarks (e.g., "Confidential") to sensitive documents.
   - Redact or remove specific content programmatically.

5. **PDF to Image Conversion**
   - Convert PDF pages into images for previews or thumbnails.

6. **Accessibility and Compliance**
   - Modify PDFs to meet accessibility standards (e.g., adding tags, alt text).

7. **Integration with Workflow Systems**
   - Use in document management systems (DMS), ERP, or CRM systems to handle PDFs automatically.

8. **Legal and Financial Applications**
   - Generate contracts, agreements, or financial statements with digital signatures.

### Example (Simple Text Extraction in Java)

```java
import org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument;
import org.apache.pdfbox.text.PDFTextStripper;

import java.io.File;

public class PDFExtractor {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (PDDocument document = PDDocument.load(new File("example.pdf"))) {
            PDFTextStripper stripper = new PDFTextStripper();
            String text = stripper.getText(document);
            System.out.println(text);
        }
    }
}
```
