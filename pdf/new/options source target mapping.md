Great question! The choice between explicit `source: target` mapping vs simple key-value pairs like `first_name: firstName` depends on your use case complexity. Let me show you both approaches and when to use each.

## Approach 1: Simple Key-Value Mapping (Recommended for Basic Cases)

### YAML Structure
```yaml
pipeline:
  field-mappings:
    # Direct mappings (same names)
    id: id
    email: email
    
    # Renamed fields  
    first_name: firstName
    last_name: lastName
    cust_status: accountStatus
    
    # For computed fields, use a special prefix or section
    computed:
      fullName: "CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)"
      accountStatus: "MAP(cust_status, {'1': 'ACTIVE', '2': 'INACTIVE'})"
      registrationDate: "DATE_FORMAT(created_timestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd')"
```

### Java Configuration
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "pipeline")
@Data
public class PipelineConfig {
    private Map<String, String> fieldMappings = new HashMap<>();
    private Map<String, String> computed = new HashMap<>();
}
```

### Pros:
- **Clean and concise** for simple rename operations
- **Easy to read and maintain** 
- **Less verbose** YAML
- **Perfect for 80% of basic ETL scenarios**

### Cons:
- **Limited flexibility** for complex transformations
- **Hard to extend** with additional metadata (like validation rules, data types, etc.)
- **Mixing simple and complex logic** can become messy

## Approach 2: Explicit Source/Target Structure (Recommended for Complex Cases)

### YAML Structure
```yaml
pipeline:
  field-mappings:
    # Simple rename
    - source: first_name
      target: firstName
      
    # Complex computed field
    - target: fullName
      computed: true
      sources: [first_name, last_name]
      transform: CONCAT
      separator: " "
      # Additional metadata you might need
      dataType: STRING
      required: true
      validation: "NOT_NULL"
      
    # Another complex field
    - target: riskScore
      computed: true
      sources: [credit_score, income, debt_ratio]
      transform: CUSTOM
      function: calculateRiskScore
      description: "Calculated risk score based on financial metrics"
```

### Pros:
- **Highly extensible** - easy to add new properties (validation, data types, descriptions, etc.)
- **Clear separation** between simple and complex mappings
- **Better for complex transformations** with multiple parameters
- **Self-documenting** with additional metadata
- **Easier to validate** configuration at startup

### Cons:
- **More verbose** for simple cases
- **Slightly more complex** YAML structure

## Approach 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

You can actually support both styles in your configuration:

### YAML Structure
```yaml
pipeline:
  field-mappings:
    # Simple style for basic mappings
    id: id
    first_name: firstName
    last_name: lastName
    
    # Complex style for computed fields
    - target: fullName
      computed: true
      sources: [first_name, last_name]
      transform: CONCAT
      separator: " "
      
    - target: accountStatus
      computed: true
      sources: [status_code]
      transform: MAP
      mapping:
        "1": "ACTIVE"
        "2": "INACTIVE"
```

### Java Configuration (Polymorphic)
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "pipeline")
@Data
public class PipelineConfig {
    // This requires custom binding logic
    private List<FieldMapping> fieldMappings = new ArrayList<>();
}

// Base interface
public interface FieldMapping {
    String getTarget();
}

// Simple mapping
@Data
public class SimpleFieldMapping implements FieldMapping {
    private String source;
    private String target;
    
    public SimpleFieldMapping(String source, String target) {
        this.source = source;
        this.target = target;
    }
}

// Complex mapping  
@Data
public class ComplexFieldMapping implements FieldMapping {
    private String target;
    private List<String> sources;
    private String transform;
    private Map<String, String> mapping;
    private String separator;
    // ... other properties
}
```

### Custom Configuration Binder
```java
@Component
public class PipelineConfigCustomizer 
    implements ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor {

    @Override
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
        if (bean instanceof PipelineConfig) {
            PipelineConfig config = (PipelineConfig) bean;
            // Convert simple key-value mappings to SimpleFieldMapping objects
            // Handle complex mappings as ComplexFieldMapping objects
        }
        return bean;
    }
}
```

## Recommendation Based on Your Use Case

Since you mentioned:
- **Sometimes field names match** (simple case)
- **Sometimes they don't** (rename case)  
- **Sometimes computed from multiple fields with transformations** (complex case)

I'd recommend **Approach 2 (Explicit Structure)** because:

1. **Your pipeline already has complexity** with computed fields
2. **Future extensibility** - you'll likely need validation, data type info, error handling, etc.
3. **Consistency** - having one consistent format is easier to maintain than mixing styles
4. **Tooling support** - explicit structure works better with IDE auto-completion and validation

### Simplified Explicit Structure for Your Case

If you want to minimize verbosity while keeping extensibility:

```yaml
pipeline:
  mappings:
    # Simple rename (implicit computed: false)
    - from: first_name
      to: firstName
      
    # Direct mapping (same name, can be omitted entirely if you auto-map same names)
    - from: id
      to: id
      
    # Computed field
    - to: fullName
      compute: "first_name + ' ' + last_name"
      
    # Complex computed field  
    - to: accountStatus
      compute: 
        type: MAP
        input: status_code
        values:
          "1": "ACTIVE"
          "2": "INACTIVE"
```

This gives you clean syntax for simple cases while supporting complex scenarios when needed.

**Bottom line**: Start with the explicit structure. The small amount of extra YAML verbosity is worth the flexibility and maintainability you'll gain as your data pipeline evolves.
