Great question 👍

Yes — when you call **`acroForm.flatten()`** in PDFBox:

* All **form fields (text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, etc.)** are **rendered as static content** on the PDF page.
* After flattening, the fields are no longer interactive — they become just **regular text/graphics**.
* ✅ **Checkboxes and radio buttons will still be visible** in their checked/selected state.
* ❌ They won’t be clickable anymore.

---

### Example:

If you do:

```java
agreeBox.check();
radioGroup.setValue("Male");
acroForm.flatten();
```

Then:

* The checkbox will show as **checked**.
* The selected radio button will show as **filled/selected**.
* The "Male" option will be visibly marked.
* But the user cannot change them in Acrobat Reader.

👉 Flattening is usually done when you want to **finalize** the document for distribution (like contracts, invoices, certificates) so recipients can’t edit the form fields.

Do you want me to show you a **before vs after flattening** example (so you see how the output PDF differs)?
