In an **event sourcing system** for the **Quoting domain** of the insurance industry, choosing the right **partition key** is crucial for performance, scalability, and consistency. Let’s analyze the two options you mentioned: **`eventID`** and **`quoteID`**.

---

### **1. Partition Key Options**

#### **a. `eventID` as Partition Key**
- **Pros**:
  - Each event is stored in its own partition, which can distribute the write load evenly across partitions.
  - Useful if you have a very high volume of events and need to scale writes horizontally.
- **Cons**:
  - Events related to the same `quoteID` will be scattered across multiple partitions.
  - Querying all events for a specific `quoteID` becomes inefficient, as it requires a **cross-partition query**, which is slower and more expensive.
  - Maintaining consistency and order of events for a single `quoteID` becomes challenging.

#### **b. `quoteID` as Partition Key**
- **Pros**:
  - All events related to the same `quoteID` are stored in the same partition.
  - Efficient for querying all events for a specific `quoteID` (single-partition query).
  - Ensures that events for a single `quoteID` are processed in the correct order.
  - Simplifies consistency and ordering within a partition.
- **Cons**:
  - If a single `quoteID` generates a very high volume of events, it can lead to a **hot partition** (overloading a single partition).
  - Requires careful design to avoid skew in partition sizes.

### **2. Recommendation: Use `quoteID` as Partition Key**
For the **Quoting domain**, **`quoteID`** is the better choice for the partition key. Here’s why:

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**:
   - In the Quoting domain, the `quoteID` represents the **aggregate root**. All events related to a quote (e.g., `QuoteCreated`, `QuoteUpdated`, `QuoteApproved`) belong to the same aggregate.
   - Storing all events for a `quoteID` in the same partition aligns with the **consistency boundary** of the aggregate.

2. **Efficient Querying**:
   - Most queries will likely involve fetching all events for a specific `quoteID`. Using `quoteID` as the partition key allows for **single-partition queries**, which are faster and more cost-effective.

3. **Event Ordering**:
   - Events within the same partition are stored in the order they were appended. This ensures that events for a `quoteID` are processed in the correct order.

4. **Scalability**:
   - While `quoteID` as the partition key can lead to hot partitions if a single quote generates a very high volume of events, this is unlikely in most insurance quoting scenarios. If it becomes an issue, you can use **sub-partitioning** (e.g., combining `quoteID` with a date or region).

### **3. Handling Hot Partitions**
If you’re concerned about hot partitions (e.g., a single quote generating a very high volume of events), you can mitigate this by:

#### **a. Sub-Partitioning**
- Combine `quoteID` with another attribute (e.g., date or region) to create a composite partition key.
- Example:
  - Partition Key: `quoteID + YYYY-MM` (e.g., `quote-123-2025-02`).
  - This ensures that events for a single `quoteID` are distributed across multiple partitions based on time.

#### **b. Splitting High-Volume Quotes**
- For quotes that generate a very high volume of events, split them into multiple logical partitions.
- Example:
  - Use a suffix (e.g., `quoteID-1`, `quoteID-2`) for high-volume quotes.

### **4. Example Schema**
Here’s an example schema for events in the Quoting domain:

```json
{
  "eventID": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", // Unique ID for the event
  "quoteID": "quote-123",                            // Partition key
  "eventType": "QuoteCreated",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "customerId": "cust-456",
    "premium": 1000,
    "coverage": "full"
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Querying Events**
With `quoteID` as the partition key, querying all events for a specific quote is efficient:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Events WHERE quoteID = 'quote-123' ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

This query will:
- Target a single partition (fast and cost-effective).
- Return events in the correct order.

---

### **6. Summary**
- **Partition Key**: Use **`quoteID`** as the partition key to align with the aggregate root and ensure efficient querying and event ordering.
- **Hot Partitions**: Mitigate hot partitions by using sub-partitioning (e.g., `quoteID + date`) or splitting high-volume quotes.
- **Event Schema**: Include `eventID` as a unique identifier for each event, but use `quoteID` for partitioning.

By following this approach, you can ensure that your event-sourcing system for the Quoting domain is scalable, efficient, and consistent.
