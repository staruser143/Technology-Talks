Yes, there are limits on the size of events you can send to Azure Event Grid. Here's a breakdown:
 * Maximum Event Size: Each individual event within an Event Grid event array is limited to 1 MB. This means the data property of your event, which contains the actual event payload, cannot exceed this size.
 * Maximum Event Array Size: When you publish events to Event Grid, you can send them in batches (an array of events). The total size of this event array cannot exceed 1 MB.
Important Considerations:
 * Billing: While the maximum event size is 1 MB, Event Grid's pricing is based on operations, and these operations are charged in 64 KB increments. So, even if your event is smaller than 1 MB, if it's over 64 KB, you'll be charged as if it were multiple events. For example, an event that is 130 KB would incur operations charges as though it were three separate events.
 * Best Practices: It's generally a good practice to keep your events as small and concise as possible. This improves performance, reduces costs, and makes your event-driven architecture more efficient. If you have large amounts of data associated with an event, consider storing that data elsewhere (e.g., Azure Blob Storage) and including a reference to the data in your Event Grid event.
Error Handling:
If you try to publish an event that exceeds the size limits, you'll receive a 413 Payload Too Large error. Your JavaScript application should be prepared to handle this error gracefully.
In summary:
 * Individual events: Up to 1 MB
 * Batches of events: Up to 1 MB total size for the array
 * Pricing: Charged in 64 KB increments
Keep these limits in mind when designing your event schema and publishing events to Azure Event Grid.
