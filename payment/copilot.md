In an event-sourcing architecture, handling payment scenarios while maintaining real-time customer updates requires a balance between consistency, responsiveness, and eventual consistency in event-driven workflows. Here's how you can approach this:

### **Option 1: Synchronous Processing (Immediate Payment Completion)**
- When the customer initiates a payment, your service directly interacts with the payment system.
- The payment is completed within the request lifecycle.
- The final payment status (`PaymentSuccessful` or `PaymentFailed`) is stored in the **event store**.
- The client receives the **final status** immediately.

**Pros:**
- Immediate status feedback to the customer.
- Simpler workflow without complex asynchronous handling.

**Cons:**
- Tightly coupled with the payment system, causing potential delays or failures in case of external system issues.
- Less scalable, especially with high payment volumes.

### **Option 2: Asynchronous Processing (Event-Driven Handling)**
- Upon payment initiation, store a `PaymentInProgress` event in the event store.
- Immediately notify the customer with a status like `"Payment request received and in process"`.
- An **event-driven handler** (e.g., microservice or worker) picks up the event and processes the payment asynchronously.
- On completion, either `PaymentSuccessful` or `PaymentFailed` events are published.
- The customer is notified accordingly via WebSockets, polling, or push notifications.

**Pros:**
- Improves responsiveness by avoiding synchronous delays.
- Scales well for high transaction volumes.
- Provides flexibility in handling retries and failures gracefully.

**Cons:**
- Customer might not receive immediate confirmation.
- Additional logic is needed for real-time notifications.

### **Which One Should You Choose?**
Since you mentioned **providing real-time status to customers**, the **best approach is hybrid asynchronous processing**:
1. Send a **real-time acknowledgment** (`PaymentInProgress` event).
2. Process payment asynchronously.
3. Use **event-driven notifications** (e.g., WebSockets, push notifications, polling) to update the customer once the payment completes.

By leveraging **event sourcing + asynchronous event-driven processing**, you ensure **both real-time responsiveness and scalability** while avoiding blocking operations on the main request flow.
