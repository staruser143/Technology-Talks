Great question. In event sourcing architecture, especially for domains like payment processing, you have two primary options depending on the nature of the transaction, user experience expectations, and business constraints like idempotency, failure tolerance, and regulatory needs.

Let’s break this down:


---

Option 1: Synchronous Integration (Direct Payment Call)

Flow:

1. User initiates payment.


2. Command is sent (e.g., MakePayment).


3. Payment service is called synchronously.


4. Based on response:

If successful: append PaymentSucceeded event.

If failed: append PaymentFailed event.



5. Return result to client.



Pros:

Immediate feedback to user.

Cleaner UX for "pay and get confirmation instantly" use cases.


Cons:

Tight coupling with payment system availability and latency.

Can’t scale well under load or transient failures.

Retry handling can be tricky if user retries after timeout.

Option 2: Asynchronous Integration (Event-Driven, Deferred Payment Processing)

Flow:

1. User initiates payment.


2. Append PaymentInitiated or PaymentRequested event.


3. Return status like "Payment processing started".


4. Background process (e.g., event handler, saga, or process manager) picks up event.


5. It calls payment system.


6. Based on response, it appends either PaymentSucceeded or PaymentFailed.


7. Notify user (WebSocket/push/email/polling) accordingly.



Pros:

Fully decoupled and scalable.

Fits well with distributed systems and failure handling (retry/payment reconciliation).

Better audit and traceability of payment steps.


Cons:

User sees only intermediate state ("in progress").

Requires additional mechanism to push/poll final result to client.

More complex orchestration (needs a process manager/saga).

Recommendation

Use Option 2 (Asynchronous) in an event-sourced system for payment unless your business demands immediate payment confirmation.

You can improve UX with:

WebSockets or Server-Sent Events to push payment result when available.

Polling with retry on client if real-time push isn’t possible.

Display status like "Payment request received. Processing...", and transition the UI state upon result notification.


This model ensures resilience, auditability, and loose coupling while supporting event replay and error recovery more effectively.
