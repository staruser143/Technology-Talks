Here are best practices for designing materialized views in Azure Cosmos DB for read models and user dashboards:


---

1. Define Clear Purpose for Each Materialized View

Focus each materialized view on a specific query pattern or user requirement.

Avoid "one-size-fits-all" views; instead, create domain-specific views (e.g., sales reports, personalized recommendations).



---

2. Optimize Schema for Query Patterns

Flatten nested data structures to minimize joins during reads.

Include frequently accessed fields directly in the materialized view.

Use denormalization to improve read performance.


Example:
Instead of:

{
  "orderId": "123",
  "customer": { "name": "John Doe", "id": "C001" },
  "items": [{ "productId": "P001", "quantity": 2 }]
}

Store:

{
  "orderId": "123",
  "customerId": "C001",
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "productIds": ["P001"],
  "quantities": [2]
}


---

3. Partition Strategically

Choose the partition key carefully to distribute data evenly across partitions.

Ensure the partition key aligns with query patterns (e.g., customerId, regionId).

Avoid hot partitions by balancing key distribution.



---

4. Leverage Change Feed for Real-Time Updates

Use Cosmos DB Change Feed to capture changes from the event store and update materialized views.

Ensure idempotency in projections to handle reprocessing scenarios.

Keep track of the last processed event using a checkpointing strategy.


Architecture Tip:

Trigger Azure Functions to process change feed events and update materialized views.



---

5. Use Multiple Consistency Levels Based on Query Needs

Select Session Consistency for dashboards tied to a user session.

Consider Bounded Staleness for analytics dashboards needing eventual convergence.



---

6. Efficient Indexing

Use custom indexing policies to speed up frequent queries.

Avoid over-indexing; index only fields used in queries.

Leverage Composite Indexes for complex queries.



---

7. Periodic View Refresh and Rebuilds

Schedule periodic rebuilds of materialized views for large datasets.

For time-sensitive data, automate full refresh based on time intervals.

Use batch processing with Azure Data Factory if needed.



---

8. Monitor and Tune Performance

Monitor query execution metrics using Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB Insights.

Optimize for RU (Request Unit) efficiency by reducing query complexity.

Partition and cache frequently accessed materialized views for performance.



---

9. Versioning of Materialized Views

Maintain backward-compatible versions of views to avoid breaking downstream systems during schema updates.

Use view version identifiers in document keys (view_v1, view_v2).



---

10. Security Best Practices

Apply Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to materialized views.

Encrypt sensitive fields before storing them.

Use private endpoints for network isolation.
