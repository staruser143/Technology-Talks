I am not able to get it.  Can you elaborate with this scenario as below. We have an healthcare insurance  D2C application which captures quote application data via multiple events and gets persisted to a collection "quote_events_col". We also have a separate "profile_col" which has details on the user who is creating the Quote. When using mongodb kafka connector to read from mongo collection and write to kafka topic,i want to use a single topic to store data from both the collections. Is this feasible ? If so let me know how it works.
