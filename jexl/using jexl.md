To check for `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `type` of data using Jexl, you can:

1. **Use built-in JavaScript properties and operators in your Jexl expressions** for length and type checks.
2. **Optionally, register custom functions** for more complex validations.

### Example Jexl Expressions

- **Min length:**  
  `'password.length >= 8'`
- **Max length:**  
  `'password.length <= 20'`
- **Type check (string):**  
  `'typeof password == "string"'`
- **Type check (number):**  
  `'typeof age == "number"'`

### Example Rule in JSON

```json
{
  "field": "passwordMinLength",
  "expr": "password.length >= 8",
  "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters",
  "code": "ERR_PASSWORD_MINLEN"
}
```

### Example: Custom Functions (optional)

If you want to reuse logic, you can register functions:

````typescript
jexl.addFunction('minLength', (val: string, min: number) => typeof val === 'string' && val.length >= min);
jexl.addFunction('maxLength', (val: string, max: number) => typeof val === 'string' && val.length <= max);
jexl.addFunction('isType', (val: any, type: string) => typeof val === type);
````

Then use in your rules:

```json
{
  "field": "passwordMinLength",
  "expr": "minLength(password, 8)",
  "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters",
  "code": "ERR_PASSWORD_MINLEN"
}
```

**Summary:**  
- Use `.length` and `typeof` in expressions for simple checks.
- Register custom functions for reusable or complex checks.  
- Reference these in your externalized rules.

# For Multi-page React App
## For a multi-page React app, it is a good practice to create separate rules JSON files for each page or form step. This approach offers these benefits:

- **Separation of concerns:** Each page or form step has only the rules relevant to its fields.
- **Easier maintenance:** You can update validation rules for a specific page without affecting others.
- **Performance:** Only load and validate the rules needed for the current page, reducing unnecessary checks.

**How to implement:**

1. **Create a JSON file for each page:**  
   For example:  
   - `rulesPage1.json`
   - `rulesPage2.json`
   - `rulesProfile.json`

2. **Load the relevant rules in your React component:**  
   You can import the JSON or fetch it dynamically if needed.

3. **Validate on submit or navigation:**  
   Run the validation function with the current page’s rules when the user submits or navigates away.

**Example:**
```javascript
import rulesPage1 from './rulesPage1.json';

async function handleSubmit(formData) {
  const errors = await validate(formData, rulesPage1);
  if (errors.length) {
    // Show errors
  } else {
    // Proceed
  }
}
```

**Summary:**  
- Use separate rules files per page.
- Validate using the relevant rules on submit or navigation.
- This keeps your validation logic modular and maintainable.

# Validate data across pages in multi-page React app
## To validate **across pages** in a multi-page React app (such as checking a field from page 2 against a field from page 1, or validating all data on final submit), you should use a **shared state** to collect all form data as the user progresses. Then, you can run your Jexl-based validation rules against this combined data object at any point.

### Best Practice Approach

1. **Centralize Form State:**  
   Use React Context, Redux, Zustand, or a parent component’s state to store all form/page data in a single object.

2. **Update State on Each Page:**  
   As the user fills each page, update the shared state with the new values.

3. **Validate with All Data:**  
   When you need to validate across pages (e.g., on the last page’s submit), run your validation rules against the full data object.

4. **Cross-Page Rules:**  
   Write rules in your JSON that reference any field, regardless of which page it was entered on.

---

### Example

**Centralized State (using React Context or Redux):**
```javascript
// Example shape
const allFormData = {
  page1: { email: '', password: '' },
  page2: { confirmPassword: '', age: 0 },
  // ...etc
};
// Or flatten if you prefer:
const allFormData = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  confirmPassword: '',
  age: 0,
  // ...
};
```

**Validation on Final Submit:**
```javascript
import rules from './rules.json'; // your externalized rules
// ...import and setup Jexl as before

async function handleFinalSubmit() {
  // allFormData contains all fields from all pages
  const errors = await validate(allFormData, rules);
  if (errors.length) {
    // Show errors
  } else {
    // Proceed
  }
}
```

**Example Cross-Page Rule (in rules.json):**
```json
{
  "field": "passwordShouldMatch",
  "expr": "password == confirmPassword",
  "message": "Passwords do not match",
  "code": "ERR_PASSWORD_MISMATCH"
}
```

---

### Summary

- **Store all form data in a single object** as the user progresses.
- **Run validation rules against the combined data** whenever needed (on navigation, on final submit, etc.).
- **Write rules that reference any field** in the data object, enabling cross-page validation.

This approach is scalable, maintainable, and works seamlessly with Jexl and externalized rule sets.

# Speed up the parsing of JSON rules at startup
To speed up the parsing of JSON rules at startup, consider these approaches:

1. **Minimize and Prettify the JSON:**  
   Remove unnecessary whitespace and comments from your JSON files. Use minified JSON for production to reduce file size and parsing time.

2. **Load JSON Asynchronously:**  
   If possible, load and parse the rules asynchronously (e.g., using `fs.promises.readFile` in Node.js or `fetch` in the browser) so it doesn’t block the main thread.

3. **Pre-compile Jexl Expressions:**  
   If you use Jexl, you can pre-compile expressions after loading the rules, so validation is faster at runtime:
   ````typescript
   // filepath: c:\Users\AD85569\azurework\service-bus-tester\src\testJexl_external.ts
   rules.forEach(rule => {
     rule.compiledExpr = jexl.createExpression(rule.expr);
   });
   // Then use rule.compiledExpr.eval(data) instead of jexl.eval(rule.expr, data)
   ````

4. **Bundle Rules at Build Time:**  
   If your rules don’t change often, import them directly as a JS/TS module instead of reading/parsing JSON at runtime:
   ```typescript
   import rules from './rules.json';
   ```

5. **Cache the Parsed Rules:**  
   Parse the JSON once at startup and reuse the parsed object throughout your app.

**Summary:**  
- Use minified JSON.
- Load and parse asynchronously.
- Pre-compile Jexl expressions.
- Import as a module if possible.
- Cache parsed rules for reuse.

These steps will help reduce startup latency due to JSON parsing and rule preparation.


# Importing rules as a module
Importing rules as a module (e.g., `import rules from './rules.json';`) improves performance because:

- **No runtime file I/O:** The rules are bundled at build time, so there’s no need to read and parse the JSON file from disk at startup.
- **No JSON parsing at runtime:** The rules are already parsed into a JavaScript object by the bundler or Node.js, eliminating the overhead of `JSON.parse`.
- **Faster startup:** Your app can access the rules immediately, reducing latency during initialization.
- **Better caching:** Module imports are cached by the runtime, so the rules are loaded only once and reused.

**Summary:**  
Importing as a module shifts parsing and loading to build time, making your app start and run faster.


# Downsides to importing rules.json as a module
Here are the main downsides to importing `rules.json` as a module:

1. **Static at Build Time:**  
   The rules are bundled at build time. Any changes to `rules.json` require a rebuild and redeploy of your app to take effect.

2. **No Dynamic Updates:**  
   You cannot update or reload rules at runtime without restarting the app.

3. **Bundle Size:**  
   Large rules files increase your JavaScript bundle size, which can impact load times, especially in web apps.

4. **No Environment-Specific Rules:**  
   You cannot easily load different rules for different environments (dev, test, prod) without additional build logic.

5. **Limited for User-Editable Rules:**  
   If you want end-users or admins to edit rules without redeploying, importing as a module will not work.

**Summary:**  
Importing as a module is fast and simple, but not suitable if you need runtime flexibility or dynamic rule management.
