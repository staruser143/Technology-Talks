JEXL (JavaScript Expression Language) requires **careful sandboxing for security** because it evaluates **dynamic expressions** that can be written and executed at runtime. This flexibility introduces potential risks, especially when expressions come from **untrusted sources** (e.g., user input, external configuration).

## üîê Why Sandbox JEXL?

### 1. **Dynamic Code Execution**
JEXL interprets expressions like:
```js
user.age > 18 && user.country === 'IN'
```
If not properly controlled, malicious users could craft expressions that:
- Access sensitive data.
- Perform unintended operations.
- Exploit custom functions or filters.

### 2. **Custom Functions and Filters**
JEXL allows you to define custom logic:
```js
jexl.addFunction('getSecret', () => secretData);
```
If exposed carelessly, these can leak internal state or sensitive information.

### 3. **Prototype Pollution / Object Access**
Expressions can traverse object paths:
```js
user.__proto__.admin = true
```
Without safeguards, this could lead to prototype pollution or manipulation of internal structures.

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Secure JEXL

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- **Never evaluate expressions from untrusted sources without validation.**
- **Limit the context**: Only expose necessary data to the expression evaluator.
- **Avoid exposing sensitive functions or objects**.
- **Use strict filters**: Validate expressions before execution.
- **Isolate execution**: Run in a secure environment if possible.

### üö´ What to Avoid
- Passing full application state or secrets into the JEXL context.
- Allowing users to define custom functions or filters without review.
- Using JEXL in security-critical paths (e.g., authentication, authorization) without strict controls.

## üß† Summary

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Arbitrary access | Expressions can access deep object paths | Limit context |
| Sensitive logic | Custom functions may expose secrets | Validate and restrict |
| Prototype pollution | Malicious expressions can alter object prototypes | Sanitize input |
| Logic abuse | Expressions may bypass intended rules | Use expression whitelisting |
