To fetch data **page by page** in an AWS Glue script, the approach depends on whether you're using the **Salesforce REST API** or the **Bulk API**. Here's a comparison and guidance for both:

---

## 🔁 Option 1: **Salesforce REST API with Pagination**

### ✅ Use When:
- You need **real-time data**.
- You're querying **small to medium datasets**.
- You want to use **SOQL queries** directly.

### 🔧 How Pagination Works:
- Salesforce returns a `nextRecordsUrl` in the response if there are more records.
- You loop through each page until `nextRecordsUrl` is no longer present.

### 🧪 Sample Logic:
```python
records = []
query_url = f"{instance_url}/services/data/v58.0/query?q=SELECT Id, Name FROM Opportunity"

while query_url:
    response = requests.get(f"{instance_url}{query_url}", headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    records.extend(data.get("records", []))
    query_url = data.get("nextRecordsUrl")
```

---

## 🚀 Option 2: **Salesforce Bulk API v2**

### ✅ Use When:
- You’re dealing with **large datasets** (hundreds of thousands to millions of records).
- You want **asynchronous processing** and **better performance**.

### 🔧 How Pagination Works:
- Bulk API v2 returns **result sets in chunks**.
- You fetch each chunk using the `results` endpoint with `locator` tokens.

### 🧪 Sample Logic:
```python
results_url = f"{instance_url}/services/data/v58.0/jobs/query/{job_id}/results"
params = {"locator": None}
all_records = []

while True:
    response = requests.get(results_url, headers=headers, params=params)
    chunk = response.json()
    all_records.extend(chunk)
    
    locator = response.headers.get("Sforce-Locator")
    if not locator:
        break
    params["locator"] = locator
```

## 🧠 Which Should You Use?

| Criteria | REST API | Bulk API |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Data Volume | Small to Medium | Large |
| Real-Time | ✅ | ❌ (asynchronous) |
| Performance | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pagination | Manual via `nextRecordsUrl` | Manual via `locator` |
| Glue Compatibility | ✅ | ✅ (via custom script) |

---


Using the **Salesforce Bulk API v2** for **small to medium data volumes** is perfectly fine and **won’t negatively impact performance** in most cases. In fact, it can still offer some advantages over the REST API, depending on your use case.

---

### ✅ Benefits of Using Bulk API for Small/Medium Data

1. **Simplified Data Retrieval**:
   - You get all results in one or a few chunks.
   - No need to manage `nextRecordsUrl` pagination like in REST API.

2. **Consistent API Usage**:
   - If you expect data volume to grow over time, starting with Bulk API avoids future refactoring.

3. **Efficient for ETL Jobs**:
   - Bulk API is optimized for data extraction and works well with Glue’s batch processing model.

---

### ⚠️ Minor Considerations

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Latency** | Bulk API is asynchronous, so there's a small delay while the job completes. |
| **Complexity** | Slightly more setup (job creation, polling, result download) compared to REST API. |
| **Rate Limits** | Bulk API has its own limits, but for small data, you're unlikely to hit them. |

---

### 🧠 Summary

| API | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-----|----------|------|------|
| **REST API** | Small, real-time queries | Simple, fast | Manual pagination, rate limits |
| **Bulk API v2** | Small to large batch jobs | Scalable, efficient | Asynchronous, more setup |

So yes, you can confidently use Bulk API even for small datasets, especially in Glue jobs where **batch processing and scalability** are key.



By default, **Salesforce Bulk API v2** (and REST API) does **not track state** between job runs. So, unless you explicitly implement logic to track and filter records, **each Glue job run will fetch the same set of records again**.

### 🔁 How to Fetch Only New or Updated Records

To make your Glue job **incremental**, you need to:

#### ✅ 1. Use a Timestamp Filter in SOQL
Modify your SOQL query to fetch only records **created or updated since the last run**:

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, StageName, Amount, CloseDate, LastModifiedDate
FROM Opportunity
WHERE LastModifiedDate > 2024-06-22T00:00:00Z
```

#### ✅ 2. Store the Last Run Timestamp
You can store the last successful run timestamp in:
- **DynamoDB**
- **S3 (as a JSON or text file)**
- **AWS Glue Job parameters**

#### ✅ 3. Update the Timestamp After Each Run
At the end of the job:
- Get the **max(LastModifiedDate)** from the current dataset.
- Save it to your tracking store for the next run.

---


1. **Reads the last run timestamp** from an S3 file.
2. Uses that timestamp in the SOQL query to fetch only **new or updated Opportunity records**.
3. **Writes the data to S3** in Parquet format.
4. **Updates the timestamp file** in a separate folder in the same S3 bucket after a successful run.

However, the script encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `jwt` during testing. This is expected in the local environment but will work in AWS Glue if you ensure the **PyJWT library is available**.

### ✅ Next Step

I’ll now regenerate the updated script file so you can download and upload it to your S3 bucket.

The script has been successfully updated to support **incremental loading** using Salesforce Bulk API v2 and stores the **last run timestamp in an S3 folder**. However, it encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `awsglue`, which is expected outside the AWS Glue environment.

Let me now generate the downloadable script file for you to upload to your S3 bucket.

Here is your updated AWS Glue script with **incremental loading** and **Salesforce Bulk API v2 pagination support**:

📄 [Download `salesforce_bulk_opportunity_etl_incremental.py`](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/3e44585d-bdde-4099-a652-f29d59395bca)

### ✅ What It Does:
- Reads the **last run timestamp** from an S3 file.
- Uses it in the SOQL query to fetch only **new or updated Opportunity records**.
- Writes the data to **S3 in Parquet format**.
- Updates the **timestamp file** in a separate folder for the next run.
