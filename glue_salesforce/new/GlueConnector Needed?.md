You have **two main options** for reading data from Salesforce in AWS Glue:

---

### âœ… **Option 1: Use a Glue Connector for Salesforce**

**Best for structured data extraction** using Spark.

- AWS provides a **Salesforce Glue Connector** (via AWS Marketplace).
- Supports **bulk and incremental loads** using SOQL.
- Works with **Glue Spark jobs**, not Python shell jobs.
- Automatically handles schema inference and parallelism.

**Pros:**
- Scalable for large datasets.
- Native integration with Glue Data Catalog.
- Easier to transform and load into S3, Redshift, etc.

**Cons:**
- Requires setup via AWS Marketplace.
- Less flexible for custom logic or authentication flows.

---

### âœ… **Option 2: Use a Python Shell Job (like the one we built)**

**Best for custom logic or lightweight tasks.**

- You manually authenticate using JWT and call Salesforce REST APIs.
- Use `requests` or `simple_salesforce` to query or update data.

**Pros:**
- Full control over authentication and API usage.
- No need for additional connectors or costs.
- Works well for small to medium data volumes or automation tasks.

**Cons:**
- You must handle pagination, retries, and schema mapping manually.
- Not ideal for large-scale ETL.

---

### ðŸ§  Recommendation

- Use the **Glue Connector** if you're doing **large-scale ETL** or want to integrate with Glue Data Catalog.
- Use the **Python shell job** if you need **custom authentication**, **flexibility**, or are working with **smaller datasets or automation tasks**.
