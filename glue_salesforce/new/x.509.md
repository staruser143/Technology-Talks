Yes, the `certificate.pem` file I generated is a **self-signed X.509 certificate** in **PEM format**. This is exactly what Salesforce expects when you enable **JWT Bearer Token Flow** in a Connected App.

### âœ… Key Characteristics:
- **Format**: X.509
- **Encoding**: PEM (Base64 with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` headers)
- **Use**: Upload to Salesforce under **"Use Digital Signatures"** in the Connected App settings.

Great question! The **file extension** of a certificate can vary depending on its format and intended use, but here's a quick breakdown:

---

### ðŸ“„ Common Certificate Extensions

| Extension | Format     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.pem`    | X.509 (PEM) | Base64-encoded with headers like `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`. Widely used in web and cloud apps. |
| `.cer`    | X.509 (DER or PEM) | Can be either binary (DER) or Base64 (PEM). Often used in Windows environments. |
| `.crt`    | X.509 (PEM) | Similar to `.pem`, commonly used in Linux systems for SSL/TLS certificates. |
| `.der`    | X.509 (DER) | Binary format of the certificate. No headers. Used in Java and Windows systems. |

### âœ… For Salesforce:
Salesforce accepts **X.509 certificates in PEM format**, so the `.pem` extension is perfectly valid and preferred. You can rename it to `.cer` if needed, but **make sure the format stays PEM** (i.e., Base64 with headers).
