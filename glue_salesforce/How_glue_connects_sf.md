Yes, when creating a **Salesforce connection in AWS Glue using OAuth 2.0**, you typically need to provide the following credentials:

---

## üîê Required OAuth Credentials in AWS Glue Connection

1. **Client ID** ‚Äì from your Salesforce Connected App  
2. **Client Secret** ‚Äì also from the Connected App  
3. **Refresh Token** ‚Äì obtained after completing the OAuth authorization flow  
4. **Access Token URL** ‚Äì usually:  
   ```
   https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
   ```

---

## üîÑ How AWS Glue Uses These to Connect

Here‚Äôs how the connection works behind the scenes:

### **Step 1: Token Exchange**
- AWS Glue uses the **refresh token** to request a **new access token** from Salesforce via the **Access Token URL**.
- This is done using a `POST` request with:
  - `grant_type=refresh_token`
  - `client_id`
  - `client_secret`
  - `refresh_token`

### **Step 2: Access Salesforce**
- Once Glue receives the **access token**, it uses it to authenticate API requests to Salesforce.
- This allows Glue to:
  - Run **SOQL queries**
  - Read **Salesforce objects**
  - Extract data for transformation and loading

### **Step 3: Automatic Token Refresh**
- Glue handles token refresh automatically using the **refresh token**, so you don‚Äôt need to manually update the access token.

---

## üß™ Example: Glue Connection Configuration

When creating the connection in the AWS Glue Console:

- **Connection type**: Salesforce
- **Authentication type**: OAuth 2.0
- **Client ID**: `3MVG9...` (from Salesforce)
- **Client Secret**: `ABC123...`
- **Refresh Token**: `5Aep861...`
- **Access Token URL**: `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`

---

Yes, exactly ‚Äî **AWS Glue automatically handles access token refresh** using the **refresh token** you provide in the Salesforce connection configuration.

---

## üîÑ What Happens When the Access Token Expires?

When the **access token expires** (which typically happens after a short period, like 15 minutes):

1. **Glue detects the expiration** during the job or crawler execution.
2. It uses the stored:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
   - **Refresh Token**
   - **Access Token URL**
3. Glue sends a request to Salesforce to **exchange the refresh token for a new access token**.
4. The new access token is used for the remainder of the job or until it expires again.

This process is **fully automated** and **transparent** to you ‚Äî no manual intervention is needed.

Great question! When using **AWS Glue Connections** to store sensitive credentials like **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **Refresh Token**, and **Access Token URL**, it's important to follow **best practices for security**.

---

## üîê Recommended Ways to Store Sensitive OAuth Credentials

### **1. Use AWS Glue Connection Parameters (Securely Stored)**
When you create a **Glue connection**, AWS securely stores the credentials you provide.

- These are encrypted using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**.
- Only Glue jobs with the appropriate **IAM role** can access the connection.
- You enter the credentials directly in the **Glue Console** under the connection configuration.

‚úÖ **Best for simplicity and integration with Glue jobs and crawlers**

---

### **2. Use AWS Secrets Manager (Optional but More Secure)**
For enhanced security and centralized secret management:

- Store **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Refresh Token** in **AWS Secrets Manager**.
- Reference the secret in your Glue job using **boto3** or custom logic.
- This is especially useful if:
  - You rotate secrets regularly
  - You want to avoid hardcoding credentials in Glue connections

‚úÖ **Best for enterprise-grade security and secret rotation**

---

### **3. Use IAM Roles and Policies**
Ensure your Glue job's **IAM role** has:
- Permission to access the Glue connection
- (Optional) Permission to access Secrets Manager if you're using it

Example policy for Secrets Manager access:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-id:secret:your-secret-name"
}
```

## üîí Summary

| Method                     | Security Level | Use Case                            |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Glue Connection Console   | High           | Simple, integrated with Glue jobs   |
| AWS Secrets Manager       | Very High      | Centralized, supports rotation      |
| IAM Role Permissions      | Essential      | Controls access to connections/secrets |

## üîç Is it necessary to store the **Access Token URL** in AWS Secrets Manager?

### **Short Answer**:  
**No**, it's **not necessary** to store the **Access Token URL** in Secrets Manager ‚Äî but you **can** if you want to centralize all connection-related values.

---

## ‚úÖ Why It's Usually Not Stored in Secrets Manager

- The **Access Token URL** is a **static, non-sensitive value**.
- For most Salesforce environments, it's one of the following:
  - **Production**: `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`
  - **Sandbox**: `https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`

Since this URL doesn't contain secrets and rarely changes, it's safe to include it **directly in the Glue connection configuration**.

---

## üîê When You *Might* Store It in Secrets Manager

You might consider storing it in Secrets Manager if:
- You're managing **multiple Salesforce environments** (e.g., dev, test, prod) and want to switch dynamically.
- You're using **custom domains** or **MyDomain** in Salesforce (e.g., `https://yourdomain.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token`)
- You want **all connection parameters** to be managed centrally for consistency and automation.

## üß† Best Practice Summary

| Parameter         | Store in Secrets Manager? | Reason |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Client ID         | ‚úÖ Yes                    | Sensitive credential |
| Client Secret     | ‚úÖ Yes                    | Sensitive credential |
| Refresh Token     | ‚úÖ Yes                    | Sensitive and long-lived |
| Access Token URL  | ‚ùå Optional               | Static and non-sensitive |

---

Here‚Äôs a **sample JSON structure** you can use to store your Salesforce OAuth credentials in **AWS Secrets Manager**:

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "refresh_token": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "access_token_url": "https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token"
}
```

---

## üîê Tips for Using This in AWS Glue

- Store this JSON as a **single secret** in Secrets Manager.
- In your Glue job, use `boto3` to retrieve the secret and parse the values.
- Example Python snippet to retrieve and use the secret:

```python
import boto3
import json

client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
secret_name = "your-secret-name"

response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
secret = json.loads(response['SecretString'])

client_id = secret['client_id']
client_secret = secret['client_secret']
refresh_token = secret['refresh_token']
access_token_url = secret['access_token_url']
```
