# How to Intrepet this chart

* Each axis represents a Dimension (eg. Cost Efficiency, Query Flexibility)
* Scores range from 1 (center) to 5 (outer edge)

## Scale Indicates Performance

* Each axis has a scale , usually from 1 (low) to 5 (high) ,indicating how well a database performs in that dimension
* A higher value , (closer to the outer edge) means better performance or scalability.
* A lower value, (closer to the center) means weaker performance or more limitations

## Polygons represent Databases
* Each database (Cosmos DB and MongoDB Atlas) is represented by a polygon connecting its scores across all dimensions
* The shape of the polygon shows the profile of strengths and weaknesses.
* The larger and more balanced the polygon, the more well-rounded the solution.
* **Blue area**: Azure Cosmos DB
* **Green area**: MongoDB Atlas


### Key Takeaways
* **CosmosDB excels in Global Distribution and Integration Complexity** (tight Azure Integration)
* **MongoDB Atlas leads in Query Flexibility and Vendor lock-in Risk** (open-source, multi-cloud)
* **Cost Efficiency and Event Sourcing Support are more balanced** , with trade-offs depending on workload type
* **Cosmos DB is better for Azure-native , globally distributed workloads**.
* **MongoDB Atlas is better for flexible querying and multi-cloud strategies**.
