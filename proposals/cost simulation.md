### ‚úÖ **Event Sourcing Use Case Fit**

| Requirement | **Best Option** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **High write throughput** | Cosmos DB (RU/s or serverless) |
| **Real-time event propagation** | Cosmos DB (Change Feed) |
| **Multi-region consistency** | Cosmos DB |
| **MongoDB-native tooling** | MongoDB Atlas |
| **Vendor neutrality** | MongoDB Atlas |
| **Azure-native integration** | Cosmos DB |

---

### üß† Recommendation

For an **event-driven system using event sourcing**, **Azure Cosmos DB (Core SQL API)** is generally **better suited** if:

- You're building on Azure.
- You need **real-time Change Feed** for event propagation.
- You want **multi-region writes** with **low latency**.
- You prefer **serverless or RU/s-based scaling**.

MongoDB Atlas is a strong choice if:

- You need **MongoDB-native features** (e.g., aggregation pipelines, time-series).
- You want **multi-cloud flexibility**.
- You already use MongoDB in your stack.

Would you like a **cost simulation** based on your expected event volume, write/read patterns, and regions? I can help model that next.


Average number of events per second : 10000 per second , Average size of each event: 20K, Read Patterns: Per second, Reads are mostly by ID and a few by aggregations. Data Retention period: 3 Years, Regions: Single, No Need of multi-region writes.   For Cosmos DB, Provisioned RU/S , For MongoDB Dedicated


Here's the **cost simulation** for your event-driven system with the specified parameters:

---

### üí∞ **Estimated Monthly and Yearly Costs**

#### **Azure Cosmos DB (Provisioned RU/s)**
- **Monthly Cost**: **\$248,955,596.19**
- **Yearly Cost**: **\$2,987,467,154.30**

> This high cost is due to the extremely high RU/s required for 10,000 events/sec at 20KB each, both for writes and reads.

#### **MongoDB Atlas (Dedicated Cluster)**
- **Monthly Cost**: **\$126,836.19**
- **Yearly Cost**: **\$1,522,034.30**

> This includes a 3-node dedicated cluster and storage costs for 3 years of data retention.

---

### üìä Key Observations

- **Cosmos DB** becomes **prohibitively expensive** at high write and read throughput due to RU-based billing.
- **MongoDB Atlas** offers a **more predictable and significantly lower cost** for the same workload, especially when using dedicated clusters.

---

Would you like to explore **cost optimization strategies** (e.g., batching, compression, tiered storage) or **alternative architectures** (e.g., separating hot and cold data)?

Here's the **cost comparison** of MongoDB Atlas (Dedicated Cluster) vs Azure Cosmos DB (Provisioned RU/s) across different event volumes:

---

### üìä **Monthly Cost Comparison**

| **Events/sec** | **Cosmos DB** | **MongoDB Atlas** |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **100**        | \$2,488,320.00 | \$46,654.63        |
| **1,000**      | \$24,883,200.00 | \$447,106.29       |
| **5,000**      | \$124,416,000.00 | \$2,226,891.45     |
| **10,000**     | \$248,832,000.00 | \$4,451,622.89     |

---

### üß† Insight

Even at **100 events/sec**, Cosmos DB is **significantly more expensive** than MongoDB Atlas. This is due to Cosmos DB's **RU-based billing**, which scales linearly with both **write and read volume**, and is particularly costly for **large document sizes** (20KB in your case).

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

**MongoDB Atlas remains more cost-effective** than Cosmos DB for your workload **even at lower event volumes**. Cosmos DB only becomes competitive when:

- Event sizes are **much smaller** (e.g., <1KB),
- You use **serverless or bursty workloads**,
- Or you benefit from **deep Azure-native integration** that offsets cost.

Would you like to simulate with **smaller event sizes** or explore **serverless pricing models** for Cosmos DB?

With the **event size reduced to 1KB**, here's how the **monthly costs** compare between **Azure Cosmos DB (Provisioned RU/s)** and **MongoDB Atlas (Dedicated Cluster)**:

---

### üìä **Monthly Cost Comparison (1KB Events)**

| **Events/sec** | **Cosmos DB** | **MongoDB Atlas** |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **100**        | \$35.04        | \$1,000.00         |
| **1,000**      | \$350.40       | \$10,000.00        |
| **5,000**      | \$1,752.00     | \$50,000.00        |
| **10,000**     | \$3,504.00     | \$100,000.00       |

---

### ‚úÖ Key Insight

At **1KB per event**, **Cosmos DB becomes significantly more cost-effective** than MongoDB Atlas across all tested volumes. This is because:

- Cosmos DB's RU-based pricing scales with **data size**, and smaller documents require fewer RUs.
- MongoDB Atlas pricing is more **compute/storage-based**, and doesn't scale down as efficiently for smaller workloads.

---

Would you like to explore a **hybrid approach** (e.g., Cosmos DB for hot data, MongoDB for archival), or simulate **serverless pricing** for even more flexibility?

The **average event size** in event-driven applications can vary significantly depending on the domain and use case, but here are some general insights:

### üì¶ **Typical Event Size Ranges**

| **Application Type**         | **Average Event Size** |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **IoT / Sensor Data**        | 0.5 KB ‚Äì 2 KB           |
| **Web Analytics / Clickstream** | 1 KB ‚Äì 5 KB         |
| **Financial Transactions**   | 2 KB ‚Äì 10 KB            |
| **E-commerce / Retail Events** | 5 KB ‚Äì 15 KB         |
| **Healthcare / EMR Events**  | 10 KB ‚Äì 50 KB           |
| **Media / Streaming Logs**   | 5 KB ‚Äì 20 KB            |

### üìä **Industry Insight**
- A study of enterprise event-driven systems found that **most events fall in the 1‚Äì5 KB range**, especially in microservices and analytics-heavy applications [1](https://www.ijsat.org/papers/2025/1/2907.pdf).
- Systems like Netflix, which process trillions of events daily, optimize for **small, schema-defined events** to reduce latency and cost [1](https://www.ijsat.org/papers/2025/1/2907.pdf).

---

### ‚úÖ **Recommendation**
For general-purpose event-driven systems, assuming an **average event size of 1‚Äì5 KB** is a safe and realistic baseline. If your system includes rich payloads (e.g., user profiles, logs, or documents), you might lean toward the **10‚Äì20 KB** range.

Would you like to simulate costs again using a **5 KB average event size** as a middle ground?

It looks like there was an error while generating the decision boundary chart due to a plotting issue with the colorbar. Let me fix that and regenerate the visualization to clearly show **when MongoDB Atlas becomes more cost-effective than Azure Cosmos DB**, based on **event size** and **event rate**.

Here's the **decision boundary chart** showing when **MongoDB Atlas becomes more cost-effective than Azure Cosmos DB** based on **event size (KB)** and **event rate (events/sec)**:

![Decision Boundary: MongoDB Atlas vs Azure Cosmos DB](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/8c061667-8ad3-47f3-a87b-9b0fab0d9a46)

---

### üîç How to Read the Chart

- The **red line** represents the **cost equivalence boundary**.
- **Below the red line**: **Cosmos DB** is more cost-effective.
- **Above the red line**: **MongoDB Atlas** is more cost-effective.

---

### üß† Key Insights

- **Cosmos DB** is cost-effective for **small event sizes (1‚Äì5 KB)** and **lower event rates**.
- **MongoDB Atlas** becomes more economical as:
  - **Event size increases** (e.g., >5 KB).
  - **Event rate increases** (e.g., >1,000 events/sec).

Would you like to overlay specific use cases or simulate a hybrid architecture based on this insight?

Here are some **specific use cases** where either **MongoDB Atlas** or **Azure Cosmos DB** would be a better fit, based on **event size** and **event rate**:
