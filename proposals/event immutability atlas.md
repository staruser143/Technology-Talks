Excellent question. While **MongoDB Atlas** is a strong candidate for flexible, developer-friendly NoSQL workloads, using it in **event-driven systems**—especially for **event sourcing and global distribution**—requires **careful design** due to the following constraints:

---

## 🔐 1. **Event Immutability: Why It Needs Careful Design**

### 🔸 **The Challenge**
- MongoDB is inherently a **mutable document store**—documents can be updated or deleted.
- Event sourcing requires **immutable event logs** where each event is a permanent record of a state change.

### 🔸 **Implications**
- Without safeguards, developers or systems might **accidentally mutate or delete events**, violating event sourcing principles.
- Lack of immutability can lead to **audit trail issues**, **inconsistent projections**, or **replay errors**.

### ✅ **Best Practices**
- **Use append-only collections**: Never update or delete documents in the event store.
- **Enforce immutability via schema validation** or **application-level constraints**.
- **Use write-once permissions**: Configure roles to allow only inserts, not updates/deletes.
- **Version events**: Include versioning to track schema evolution without modifying past events.

## 🌍 2. **Global Distribution: Why It’s Not Plug-and-Play**

### 🔸 **The Challenge**
- MongoDB Atlas supports **global clusters**, but:
  - You must **manually configure shard keys** and **zone mappings**.
  - **Write latency** increases if writes are routed to distant regions.
  - **Read/write locality** must be explicitly managed.

### 🔸 **Implications**
- Poor shard key design can lead to **hot partitions** or **cross-region latency**.
- Without proper zone configuration, **data sovereignty** or **compliance** issues may arise.
- **Event ordering** can be affected if events are written from multiple regions without coordination.

### ✅ **Best Practices**
- **Design shard keys carefully**: Use a combination of tenant ID + timestamp to ensure even distribution and ordering.
- **Use zone-based sharding**: Pin data to specific regions based on user geography.
- **Enable read/write locality**: Route reads and writes to the nearest region using **read/write preferences**.
- **Use Change Streams with care**: Ensure they are region-aware and resilient to failovers.

| Mutable by default     | Risk of event tampering                     | Enforce immutability via schema and permissions    |
| Manual global setup    | Complex configuration, latency issues       | Use zone-based sharding and locality-aware routing |
| No native ordering     | Event ordering may break across regions     | Use timestamped shard keys and logical clocks      |
