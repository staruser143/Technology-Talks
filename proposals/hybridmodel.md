## ðŸ§  Justifying the Hybrid Model

### **1. Separation of Concerns**
- **Event Store (Cosmos DB)**: Optimized for high-throughput, low-latency writes, and global distributionâ€”ideal for immutable event logs.
- **Domain Store (MongoDB Atlas)**: Optimized for flexible querying and schema evolutionâ€”ideal for read models and projections.

This separation aligns with **CQRS principles**, ensuring each component is optimized for its specific workload.

---

### **2. Cost Efficiency Through Specialization**
- Cosmos DB is **cost-effective for write-heavy workloads** with predictable RU/s.
- MongoDB Atlas is **cost-effective for read-heavy workloads** with complex queries and indexing.

Using each for what they do best can **reduce total cost of ownership** compared to over-provisioning a single system to handle both workloads suboptimally.

---

### **3. Integration Overhead is Manageable**
- Both services offer **native SDKs**, **REST APIs**, and **event streaming capabilities** (e.g., Cosmos DB Change Feed, MongoDB Change Streams).
- Integration can be abstracted via a **message broker** (e.g., Azure Event Grid, Kafka, or RabbitMQ), which is already common in event-driven systems.

---

### **4. Vendor Lock-in Mitigation**
- Using MongoDB Atlas (multi-cloud) alongside Cosmos DB (Azure-native) provides **cloud portability** and **negotiation leverage**.
- This hybrid approach avoids full lock-in to a single vendor ecosystem.

## ðŸŸ¨ If Client Prefers a Single Platform

### **Option A: All-in on Azure Cosmos DB**
- Use Cosmos DB for both event and domain stores.
- Pros: Unified billing, native Azure integration.
- Cons: Less flexible querying for projections; may require custom indexing and transformation logic.

### **Option B: All-in on MongoDB Atlas**
- Use MongoDB for both event and domain stores.
- Pros: Rich query language, flexible schema, developer familiarity.
- Cons: Requires careful design for event immutability and global distribution.
