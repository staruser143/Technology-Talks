You're absolutely right‚Äî**MongoDB Atlas** shines in **query flexibility** due to its powerful **aggregation pipeline**, which makes it ideal for building **dynamic read models** in CQRS. However, if you're using **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**, you still have viable options to build dynamic and efficient read models, though it requires a different approach.

## üß© Options for Building Dynamic Read Models in Cosmos DB

### **1. Precomputed Projections via Change Feed + Azure Functions**
- **How it works**: Use the **Change Feed** to listen for new events and trigger **Azure Functions** to:
  - Transform event data.
  - Write **precomputed read models** into separate containers.
- **Benefits**:
  - Fast, low-latency reads.
  - Tailored read models for specific query patterns.
- **Limitation**: Less flexible for ad-hoc queries; you must anticipate query needs.

---

### **2. Denormalized Document Design**
- Embed related data within documents to avoid joins.
- Design documents around **query patterns**, not normalized entities.
- Example: Store a user‚Äôs profile, preferences, and recent activity in a single document.

---

### **3. Multiple Read Containers**
- Create **specialized containers** for different read models.
- Each container is optimized for a specific projection or view.
- This aligns with CQRS: **write once, read many ways**.

---

### **4. Use Azure Synapse Link for Analytics**
- For complex, ad-hoc queries or aggregations, enable **Synapse Link**.
- It replicates Cosmos DB data into an **analytical store** without impacting transactional performance.
- You can then use **T-SQL or Spark** for advanced querying.

---

### **5. Composite Indexes for Query Optimization**
- Define **custom composite indexes** to support sorting and filtering on multiple fields.
- Helps simulate some aggregation-like behavior efficiently.
