Great question! The **container-per-entity** and **container-per-aggregate** patterns are **data modeling strategies** in Azure Cosmos DB that help optimize performance, scalability, and query efficiency—especially in systems using **CQRS** and **event sourcing**.

Let’s break down each pattern and how they help address Cosmos DB’s limitations.

## 🧱 1. Container-per-Entity Pattern

### 🔹 What It Is:
- Each **entity type** (e.g., `User`, `Order`, `Product`) has its own **dedicated container**.
- Containers are optimized for the **specific access patterns** of that entity.

### ✅ Benefits:
- **Simplifies indexing**: You can tailor indexing policies per entity.
- **Improves query performance**: Queries are scoped to a single container.
- **Reduces RU/s consumption**: Avoids scanning unrelated data.

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:
- More containers to manage.
- Cross-entity queries require application-level joins.

## 🧩 2. Container-per-Aggregate Pattern

### 🔹 What It Is:
- Each **aggregate root** (from DDD) has its own container.
- An aggregate is a cluster of related entities treated as a single unit (e.g., `Order` + `OrderItems`).

### ✅ Benefits:
- **Encapsulates related data**: Ideal for transactional boundaries.
- **Supports denormalization**: Embed related entities for fast reads.
- **Aligns with CQRS**: Write model (aggregate) is isolated from read models.

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:
- Requires careful design to avoid large documents.
- May duplicate data across aggregates.

## 🛠️ How These Patterns Help with Cosmos DB Limitations

| Cosmos DB Limitation              | How These Patterns Help                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited query flexibility        | Scope queries to specific containers with tailored indexing. |
| No joins                         | Use denormalized documents within aggregates.        |
| RU/s cost unpredictability       | Isolate workloads to containers with predictable usage. |
| Indexing complexity              | Customize indexing per container to reduce overhead. |

## 📊 Use Case Example

| Pattern                  | Use Case Example                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Container-per-Entity     | Separate containers for `User`, `Product`, `Order`. |
| Container-per-Aggregate | One container for `Order` with embedded `OrderItems`. |
