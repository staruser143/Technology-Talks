## üìÑ Proposal: Data Store Evaluation for Event-Driven Architecture

### **1. Executive Summary**
This proposal evaluates Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and MongoDB Atlas as potential data stores for a new event-driven system based on CQRS and event sourcing. It provides a comparative analysis and a recommendation for the ideal data store for both **event data** and **domain data**.

---

### **2. System Requirements Overview**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **CQRS Pattern**
- **Event Sourcing**
- **Scalability & Global Distribution**
- **Low Latency Reads/Writes**
- **High Availability**
- **Flexible Schema for Domain Modeling**

---

### **3. Data Store Roles**
- **Event Store**: Stores immutable events that represent state changes.
- **Domain Store**: Stores current state projections (read models) for queries.

---

### **4. Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- **Global Distribution**: Multi-region writes and reads.
- **Multi-model Support**: Supports document, key-value, graph, and column-family models.
- **Automatic Indexing**: No index management required.
- **Elastic Scalability**: Throughput and storage scale independently.
- **Integration with Azure Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with Azure Functions, Event Grid, etc.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations**
- **Pricing Complexity**: Based on RU/s (Request Units).
- **Limited Query Flexibility**: Compared to MongoDB‚Äôs aggregation framework.
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tightly coupled with Azure.

---

### **5. MongoDB Atlas**

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- **Rich Query Language**: Powerful aggregation framework.
- **Flexible Schema**: Ideal for evolving domain models.
- **Change Streams**: Native support for event-driven patterns.
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Runs on AWS, Azure, GCP.
- **Developer Familiarity**: Widely adopted and supported.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations**
- **Global Distribution**: Available but more manual setup than Cosmos DB.
- **Operational Overhead**: Indexing and performance tuning may be needed.
- **Event Sourcing Support**: Requires custom implementation or use of third-party tools.

### **6. Comparative Analysis Table**

| Feature                        | Azure Cosmos DB         | MongoDB Atlas            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Global Distribution           | Native, automatic        | Available, manual setup   |
| Query Language                | SQL-like, limited        | Rich aggregation framework|
| Schema Flexibility            | Moderate                 | High                      |
| Event Sourcing Support        | Custom implementation    | Change Streams available  |
| Integration with Cloud Events | Native with Azure        | Requires setup            |
| Pricing Model                 | RU/s based               | Storage + Ops based       |
| Developer Ecosystem           | Azure-centric            | Broad, open-source        |

### **7. Recommendation**

#### üü¶ **Event Store**
- **Recommended**: **Azure Cosmos DB**
- **Reason**: Native support for global distribution, high availability, and seamless integration with Azure Functions/Event Grid for event publishing.

#### üü© **Domain Store**
- **Recommended**: **MongoDB Atlas**
- **Reason**: Rich query capabilities and flexible schema make it ideal for read models and projections in CQRS.

---

### **8. Conclusion**
Using Cosmos DB for event storage and MongoDB Atlas for domain projections provides a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of both platforms, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and performance in an event-driven system.
