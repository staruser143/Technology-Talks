**DAPR** stands for **Distributed Application Runtime**.

It is an **open-source, portable, event-driven runtime** that makes it easier for developers to build resilient, microservices-based applications that run on the cloud and edge.

Developed initially by Microsoft and now part of the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** as an incubating project, Dapr provides a set of common building blocks that abstract away the complexity of distributed systems.

### 🎯 **Key Goals of DAPR**

- Simplify building microservices
- Be programming language agnostic
- Work across any cloud, on-prem, or edge environment
- Avoid vendor or platform lock-in
- Enable developers to focus on business logic, not infrastructure plumbing

### 🧱 **Core Building Blocks**

Dapr offers a set of standardized APIs (called "building blocks") that you can use via HTTP or gRPC. These include:

1. **Service Invocation** – Call other services reliably and securely.
2. **State Management** – Store and retrieve key/value state, with pluggable backing stores (Redis, Cosmos DB, etc.).
3. **Publish & Subscribe** – Event-driven messaging between services.
4. **Event-Driven Resource Bindings** – Connect to external systems (e.g., Kafka, AWS S3, Azure Event Hubs) without SDKs.
5. **Actors** – Scalable, single-threaded actor model for stateful workloads.
6. **Observability** – Distributed tracing, metrics, and logs out-of-the-box.
7. **Secrets Management** – Securely retrieve secrets from secret stores (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).
8. **Configuration** – Get and subscribe to application configuration items.
9. **Distributed Locks** (preview) – Coordinate access to shared resources.
10. **Workflow** (preview) – Orchestrate long-running, stateful workflows.

### 🖥️ **How It Works**

Dapr runs as a **sidecar** (a companion process or container) next to your application. Your app communicates with Dapr via HTTP or gRPC APIs, and Dapr handles interactions with infrastructure components.

```
[Your App] ←HTTP/gRPC→ [Dapr Sidecar] ←→ [Infrastructure: Redis, Kafka, etc.]
```

This sidecar model means **your app doesn’t need to include SDKs or libraries** for specific cloud services — Dapr abstracts them away.

---

### 🌐 **Portability**

Dapr is **platform-agnostic** — it runs on:

- Kubernetes
- Standalone (on your local machine or VM)
- IoT Edge
- Other platforms via community contributions

You can develop locally and deploy to any supported environment without code changes.

### 💡 Example Use Case

Imagine you’re building a shopping cart service:

- Use **State Management** to store cart items.
- Use **Pub/Sub** to notify order service when checkout happens.
- Use **Secrets Management** to securely get database credentials.
- Use **Observability** to trace requests across services.

All without writing Redis or Kafka-specific code.

### ✅ Why Use DAPR?

- Reduces boilerplate code for distributed systems
- Increases developer velocity
- Improves portability and avoids vendor lock-in
- Integrates well with Kubernetes and cloud-native ecosystems
- Strong community and CNCF backing

In short, **Dapr is like a universal adapter for microservices** — letting you plug into any infrastructure using simple APIs, while keeping your code clean and portable.
