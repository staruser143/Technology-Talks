# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Selection of MongoDB Atlas for Event and Domain Data Store

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We are building a new event-driven system based on event sourcing and CQRS. A critical component of this architecture is the event and domain data store. We evaluated MongoDB Atlas and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as potential candidates.

## Decision
We have decided to use **MongoDB Atlas** as the event and domain data store for the following reasons:

### 1. Open Source Nature
MongoDB is open source, which aligns with our preference for transparent and community-driven technologies. Azure Cosmos DB is a proprietary solution.

### 2. Multi-Cloud Support
MongoDB Atlas supports deployment across AWS, Azure, and GCP, offering flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. Cosmos DB is tightly integrated with Azure.

### 3. Aggregation Query Support
MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that is well-suited for querying event streams and domain models. Cosmos DB supports SQL-like queries but lacks the same level of aggregation capabilities.

### 4. Team Expertise
Our team has extensive experience with MongoDB from prior projects, which reduces the learning curve and accelerates development.

### 5. Cost and Pricing
MongoDB Atlas offers a flexible pricing model with auto-scaling and a free tier for experimentation. Cosmos DB uses a Request Unit (RU) based pricing model, which is often seen as complex and harder to predict. MongoDB Atlas has been reported to offer 25â€“30% cost savings in some scenarios.

## Additional Evaluation Criteria

### 6. Performance and Scalability
MongoDB Atlas supports horizontal scaling through sharding and is optimized for high-throughput workloads, making it suitable for event-driven architectures.

### 7. Operational Maturity and Tooling
MongoDB Atlas provides robust operational tooling including monitoring, backups, and automation. It integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and DevOps workflows.

### 8. Security and Compliance
MongoDB Atlas supports encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and compliance with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2.

### 9. Data Modeling Flexibility
MongoDB's document model allows for flexible schema design, which is beneficial for evolving event and domain models. It also supports schema versioning.

### 10. Latency and Global Distribution
MongoDB Atlas offers global clusters and multi-region replication, enabling low-latency access and high availability across geographies.

### 11. Support for Change Streams / Real-Time Processing
MongoDB natively supports change streams, which are essential for building reactive systems and implementing CQRS patterns.

### 12. Community and Ecosystem
MongoDB has a large and active developer community, extensive documentation, and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.

### 13. Vendor Lock-In Risk
MongoDB's open source foundation and multi-cloud support reduce the risk of vendor lock-in compared to Cosmos DB, which is Azure-specific.

## Consequences
We will proceed with implementing MongoDB Atlas as the primary data store for events and domain models. This decision will influence our infrastructure provisioning, data modeling, and operational practices.
