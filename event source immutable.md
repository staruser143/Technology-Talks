You're absolutely correct that in an **event-sourcing system**, events are **immutable** and only **appended** to the event store. If each event has a **unique event ID** (like a UUID) and you implement proper **idempotency checks**, you can avoid many concurrency issues. However, there are still some nuances to consider, especially when dealing with **event ordering** and **causality** in a distributed system. Let me clarify why **versioning** might still be useful and how you can handle concurrency without it if you rely solely on unique event IDs.

---

### **1. Why Versioning Might Still Be Useful**
Versioning is not strictly necessary if you’re only appending events with unique IDs, but it can help in certain scenarios:

#### **a. Ensuring Correct Event Order**
- In event sourcing, the **order of events** matters because it determines the state of the aggregate.
- If two events are appended concurrently, you need a way to ensure they are processed in the correct order.
- **Versioning** (e.g., a sequence number) helps enforce this order.

#### **b. Detecting Gaps in the Event Stream**
- If events are appended out of order (e.g., due to network delays or retries), you might end up with gaps in the event stream.
- Versioning helps detect and resolve these gaps.

#### **c. Handling Causal Dependencies**
- Some events might depend on previous events (e.g., `Event B` should only be processed after `Event A`).
- Versioning helps enforce these causal dependencies.

### **2. How to Handle Concurrency Without Versioning**
If you rely solely on **unique event IDs** and **idempotency checks**, you can still handle concurrency effectively. Here’s how:

#### **a. Unique Event IDs**
- Each event has a **globally unique ID** (e.g., a UUID).
- This ensures that no two events are identical, even if they represent the same logical change.

#### **b. Idempotency Checks**
- Before appending an event, check if an event with the same ID already exists in the event store.
- If it does, skip the append operation to avoid duplicates.

#### **c. Event Ordering**
- Use a **timestamp** or **logical clock** (e.g., Lamport timestamp) to order events.
- This ensures that events are processed in the correct order, even if they arrive out of sequence.

#### **d. Concurrency Control**
- Use **conditional writes** to ensure that events are appended atomically.
- For example, in Cosmos DB, you can use a pre-condition to check if the event ID already exists before appending.

### **3. Example Workflow Without Versioning**
Here’s how you can handle concurrency without versioning:

#### **Step 1: Generate a Unique Event ID**
- When creating an event, generate a unique ID (e.g., UUID).
  ```json
  {
    "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "streamId": "stream-123",
    "data": "{\"amount\": 100}",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-13T12:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

#### **Step 2: Check for Duplicates**
- Before appending the event, check if an event with the same ID already exists.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Events WHERE eventId = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
  ```
  If the count is greater than 0, skip the append.

#### **Step 3: Append the Event**
- Append the event to the event store.
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Events (eventId, streamId, data, timestamp)
  VALUES ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'stream-123', '{"amount": 100}', '2025-02-13T12:00:00Z')
  ```

#### **Step 4: Handle Concurrency Conflicts**
- If two clients attempt to append events concurrently, use a **conditional write** to ensure atomicity.
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Events (eventId, streamId, data, timestamp)
  VALUES ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'stream-123', '{"amount": 100}', '2025-02-13T12:00:00Z')
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Events WHERE eventId = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000')
  ```

#### **Step 5: Process Events in Order**
- When reading events, sort them by `timestamp` or a logical clock to ensure correct ordering.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Events WHERE streamId = 'stream-123' ORDER BY timestamp ASC
  ```

### **4. When Versioning Is Still Helpful**
While you can handle concurrency without versioning, versioning is still useful in the following scenarios:

#### **a. Rebuilding State**
- When rebuilding the state of an aggregate from the event stream, versioning helps ensure that events are applied in the correct order.

#### **b. Detecting Gaps**
- Versioning helps detect gaps in the event stream (e.g., missing events due to failures or retries).

#### **c. Optimistic Concurrency Control**
- Versioning simplifies optimistic concurrency control by providing a clear way to detect conflicts.

---

### **5. Summary**
- If you use **unique event IDs** and implement **idempotency checks**, you can handle concurrency effectively without versioning.
- However, versioning is still useful for ensuring **event ordering**, **causal dependencies**, and **rebuilding state**.
- Choose the approach that best fits your system’s requirements:
  - **Without Versioning**: Rely on unique event IDs, idempotency checks, and timestamps.
  - **With Versioning**: Use sequence numbers or version numbers to enforce ordering and detect conflicts.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your event-sourcing system remains consistent and free from concurrency issues, even in a distributed environment.
