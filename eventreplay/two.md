Yes, the **replayEvents** method needs to have access to the **DomainAggregate** class because it is responsible for reconstructing the current state of the aggregate by applying events sequentially. Without knowledge of **DomainAggregate**, the method wouldn't know how to apply each event or structure the evolving state.

### **Why Access to DomainAggregate is Needed?**
- The method iterates through the historical events and **applies** them to the aggregate.
- It uses **applyEvent(event)** within **DomainAggregate** to update the state based on event types.
- Without this connection, replaying events would just be retrieving data, not reconstructing meaningful state.

### **Possible Approaches**
#### 1. **Direct Coupling (Most Common)**
Make **replayEvents** part of the **DomainAggregateService** which has access to **DomainAggregate**:
```typescript
class DomainAggregateService {
  constructor(private eventStoreService: EventStoreService) {}

  async replayEvents(aggregateId: string): Promise<DomainAggregate> {
    const events = await this.eventStoreService.getEvents(aggregateId);
    const aggregate = new DomainAggregate();

    for (const event of events) {
      aggregate.applyEvent(event);
    }

    return aggregate;
  }
}
```
Here, **DomainAggregateService** manages the rehydration process, ensuring that **DomainAggregate** is properly constructed.

#### 2. **Loosely Coupled via Factory or DTO**
You can create a **factory method** that reconstructs the aggregate outside the service:
```typescript
function hydrateAggregate(events: EventDocument[]): DomainAggregate {
  const aggregate = new DomainAggregate();

  events.forEach(event => aggregate.applyEvent(event));

  return aggregate;
}
```
This method can be used in any service without **tight coupling** to **DomainAggregate**.

### **Trade-offs**
| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Direct Coupling** | Easier to manage, domain logic centralized | Tightly bound to DomainAggregate |
| **Factory Method** | More flexible, reusable across services | Extra abstraction might be unnecessary |

Would you like to add **snapshot restoration** to optimize replaying large event streams? That could significantly improve performance for complex aggregates.
