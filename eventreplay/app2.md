Absolutely! Approach #2, the **Strategy Pattern for Event Processing**, focuses on making the **event replay logic generic** by using a **higher-order function** to process events. This keeps the **replay logic independent of any specific domain aggregate**, allowing different aggregates to reconstruct their state without direct coupling.

### **How It Works**
Instead of requiring a domain aggregate to handle events directly, this approach:
1. **Extracts event replay logic into a dedicated class (`EventProcessor`).**
2. **Passes a function (`applyFn`) that knows how to apply events.**
3. **Uses an initial state (`initialState`) and updates it step-by-step using events.**

This design allows **different aggregates or models to use the same event replay mechanism** without modifying the core event replay logic.

### **Code Implementation**

#### **1. EventProcessor Class**
This class handles event replay **without knowing about any specific aggregate**:
```typescript
class EventProcessor {
  constructor(private eventStoreService: EventStoreService) {}

  async replayEvents<T>(
    aggregateId: string, 
    applyFn: (event: EventDocument, state: T) => T, 
    initialState: T
  ): Promise<T> {
    const events = await this.eventStoreService.getEvents(aggregateId);

    return events.reduce((state, event) => applyFn(event, state), initialState);
  }
}
```
##### **How It Works:**
- `aggregateId`: The unique identifier for the aggregate we're reconstructing.
- `applyFn`: A function that knows how to apply an event to the state.
- `initialState`: The default state before any events are processed.
- Uses `.reduce()` to **apply events sequentially**, updating the state step-by-step.

#### **2. Using the EventProcessor**
Different domain aggregates can define their own event application logic **without modifying EventProcessor**.

##### **Example 1: User Aggregate**
```typescript
class UserAggregate {
  name: string = "";
  email: string = "";
}

function applyUserEvent(event: EventDocument, state: UserAggregate): UserAggregate {
  switch (event.eventType) {
    case 'UserRegistered':
      state.name = event.payload.name;
      state.email = event.payload.email;
      break;
    case 'EmailUpdated':
      state.email = event.payload.email;
      break;
  }
  return state;
}
```
**Calling replay:**
```typescript
const eventProcessor = new EventProcessor(eventStoreService);
const userState = await eventProcessor.replayEvents(userId, applyUserEvent, new UserAggregate());
```
✅ **No direct dependency on `UserAggregate` inside `EventProcessor`.**

---

##### **Example 2: Order Aggregate**
```typescript
class OrderAggregate {
  items: string[] = [];
  status: string = "Pending";
}

function applyOrderEvent(event: EventDocument, state: OrderAggregate): OrderAggregate {
  switch (event.eventType) {
    case 'ItemAdded':
      state.items.push(event.payload.item);
      break;
    case 'OrderCompleted':
      state.status = "Completed";
      break;
  }
  return state;
}
```
**Calling replay for orders:**
```typescript
const orderState = await eventProcessor.replayEvents(orderId, applyOrderEvent, new OrderAggregate());
```
✅ **Replays order events using the same event processor, but with a different function.**

---

### **Key Benefits**
| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|------------|
| **No Tight Coupling** | The event replay logic is **generic**, reusable across multiple aggregates. |
| **Flexible Event Processing** | Each aggregate defines **its own logic** for processing events. |
| **Reusable in Multiple Services** | Can be moved to a **common library** for shared use. |
| **Encapsulation of Replay Logic** | Changes to event replay mechanism don’t affect domain models. |

Would you like to extend this with **snapshot-based restoration** so older aggregates don’t have to replay every event?
