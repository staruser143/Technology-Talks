Yes, you can make the **event replay logic** generic by designing a **flexible event processing pipeline** that doesnâ€™t depend on the `DomainAggregate` class directly. Instead, you can use an **event handler interface** or a **strategy pattern** to allow different aggregates to process events without tight coupling.

### **Approach 1: Event Handler Interface (Most Flexible)**
Define an interface that any aggregate can implement:
```typescript
interface EventHandler<T> {
  applyEvent(event: EventDocument): T;
}
```
Then, modify your replay logic to work with any class implementing this interface:
```typescript
async replayEvents<T extends EventHandler<T>>(aggregateId: string, handler: T): Promise<T> {
  const events = await this.getEvents(aggregateId);

  for (const event of events) {
    handler.applyEvent(event);
  }

  return handler;
}
```
This way, different aggregates can provide their own event application logic without hard dependencies.

### **Approach 2: Strategy Pattern for Event Processing**
Instead of having aggregates process events directly, use an **event processor**:
```typescript
class EventProcessor {
  constructor(private eventStoreService: EventStoreService) {}

  async replayEvents<T>(aggregateId: string, applyFn: (event: EventDocument, state: T) => T, initialState: T): Promise<T> {
    const events = await this.eventStoreService.getEvents(aggregateId);

    return events.reduce((state, event) => applyFn(event, state), initialState);
  }
}
```
This enables **pure functions** to be passed for event application without coupling to the aggregate.

### **When a Common Library is Needed**
If different services need to replay events **but have unique ways of applying them**, you should place:
- **Event Processing Utilities** (e.g., `EventProcessor` or event replay logic)
- **Common Event Schemas** (event store models)
- **Shared Interfaces** (like `EventHandler`)
in a **shared library** so that multiple services can reuse the replay logic.

Would you like to integrate **snapshot restoration** into this design? That would prevent redundant replays for large aggregates.
