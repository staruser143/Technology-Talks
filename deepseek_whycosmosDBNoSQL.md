# **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API as Event Sourcing Data Store and Read Model Domain Store**

## **Introduction**
Event sourcing is a pattern where state changes in an application are stored as a sequence of events. These events are immutable and can be replayed to reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time. A read model domain store, on the other hand, is a projection of the event stream optimized for querying and displaying data.

Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model database service, is an excellent choice for both event sourcing and read model storage. This document explores the benefits of using **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API** for these purposes and compares it with alternatives like **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API** and **Atlas MongoDB**.

## **Benefits of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API**

### **1. Event Sourcing Data Store**
Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API is well-suited for event sourcing due to the following features:

#### **a. Schema-Agnostic Data Model**
- The NoSQL API allows for flexible schema design, which is ideal for storing events that may have varying structures over time.
- Events can be stored as JSON documents, making it easy to serialize and deserialize event data.

#### **b. High Write Throughput**
- Azure Cosmos DB provides single-digit millisecond latency for writes, ensuring that events are stored quickly and reliably.
- It supports automatic scaling of throughput, which is critical for handling high-velocity event streams.

#### **c. Global Distribution and Multi-Region Writes**
- Events can be written to multiple regions simultaneously, ensuring low-latency access and high availability.
- This is particularly useful for distributed systems that require global event sourcing.

#### **d. Change Feed**
- The built-in change feed feature allows you to stream events in real-time, enabling downstream systems to react to changes immediately.
- This is useful for building projections and updating read models.

#### **e. Durability and Consistency**
- Azure Cosmos DB guarantees durability with automatic backups and point-in-time restores.
- It offers multiple consistency levels (e.g., strong, bounded staleness, session, consistent prefix, eventual), allowing you to balance performance and consistency based on your needs.

### **2. Read Model Domain Store**
Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API is also an excellent choice for storing read models built from event stream projections:

#### **a. High Query Performance**
- The NoSQL API supports SQL-like queries, making it easy to query read models efficiently.
- Indexing is automatic and customizable, ensuring fast access to data.

#### **b. Scalability**
- Read models can scale independently of the event store, allowing you to optimize for read-heavy workloads.
- Azure Cosmos DB supports horizontal partitioning (partition keys) to distribute data and queries across multiple nodes.

#### **c. Real-Time Updates**
- By leveraging the change feed, read models can be updated in real-time as new events are processed.
- This ensures that the read model is always up-to-date with the latest state.

#### **d. Cost Efficiency**
- Azure Cosmos DB offers serverless and provisioned throughput modes, allowing you to optimize costs based on your workload.
- You only pay for the storage and throughput you use.

## **Comparison with Alternatives**

### **1. Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API**
- **Pros:**
  - Provides MongoDB compatibility, which may be beneficial if your team is already familiar with MongoDB.
  - Offers similar global distribution and scalability features as the NoSQL API.
- **Cons:**
  - Limited to MongoDB's query language and features, which may not be as flexible as the NoSQL API for event sourcing.
  - The change feed feature is not as robust as the NoSQL API's change feed.

### **2. Atlas MongoDB**
- **Pros:**
  - Fully managed MongoDB service with global distribution capabilities.
  - Familiar MongoDB query language and ecosystem.
- **Cons:**
  - Lacks the native change feed feature of Azure Cosmos DB, making real-time projections more complex.
  - Limited consistency options compared to Azure Cosmos DB.
  - Higher operational overhead for managing global distribution and scaling.

## **Why Choose Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API?**
- **Unified Platform:** Use the same database for both event sourcing and read models, simplifying architecture and operations.
- **Global Scale:** Built-in global distribution ensures low latency and high availability for distributed systems.
- **Real-Time Capabilities:** The change feed enables real-time updates to read models, ensuring consistency between the event store and read models.
- **Flexibility:** The schema-agnostic data model and support for SQL-like queries make it versatile for both event storage and read model optimization.

---

## **Conclusion**
Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL API is a powerful choice for event sourcing and read model storage, offering unparalleled scalability, global distribution, and real-time capabilities. While alternatives like Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API and Atlas MongoDB have their merits, the NoSQL API's flexibility and advanced features make it the superior option for modern, distributed applications.
