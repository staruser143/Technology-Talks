These are the three foundational legal frameworks that make electronic signatures "legally binding." If you are building your own solution, your system must satisfy the requirements of these laws to be enforceable in court.

Think of **ESIGN** and **UETA** as the "permissive" American standards, and **eIDAS** as the "structured" European standard.

### 1. The U.S. Framework: ESIGN & UETA

In the United States, these two laws work together to ensure that a contract cannot be denied legal effect just because it is electronic.

* **ESIGN Act (2000):** A **federal** law that grants electronic signatures the same legal status as handwritten ones for interstate and foreign commerce.
* **UETA (1999):** A **state-level** framework adopted by 49 states (New York has its own similar law). It provides more granular rules for how states should handle electronic records.

#### The 4 "Must-Haves" for U.S. Compliance:

To comply with these, your custom-built app **must** include:

1. **Intent to Sign:** The user must take a clear action (e.g., clicking "I Accept" or drawing a name).
2. **Consent to Do Business Electronically:** You must provide a disclosure and get the user's "click-wrap" agreement to sign digitally.
3. **Association of Record:** The system must "attach" the signature to the document (typically done via a cryptographic hash).
4. **Record Retention:** The signer must be able to download or receive a copy of the final signed document for their own records.

### 2. The EU Framework: eIDAS

The **eIDAS** (Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services) is the EU regulation. Unlike the U.S. "one-size-fits-all" approach, eIDAS uses a **tiered system** based on how much you trust the signer's identity.

| Tier | Name | How it works | Typical Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SES** | **Simple** | Just a mark or a "check box." No identity verification required. | Low-stakes internal HR forms. |
| **AdES** | **Advanced** | Requires the signature to be uniquely linked to the signer and the document to be "tamper-evident" (using PKI/Digital Certificates). | B2B contracts, invoices. |
| **QES** | **Qualified** | The highest level. Requires a "Qualified Signature Creation Device" (like a smart card) and a certificate from a government-vetted provider. | High-value real estate, court docs. |

### Summary for your Build

* **If you operate in the US:** Focus on the "4 Must-Haves" above. You don't necessarily need complex digital certificates for most business contracts; a standard audit trail (IP, Timestamp, Email) usually suffices.
* **If you operate in the EU:** You likely need to implement **AdES** (Advanced) at a minimum, which means your custom code will need to handle **X.509 Digital Certificates** and hashing to ensure the document cannot be altered after signing.
